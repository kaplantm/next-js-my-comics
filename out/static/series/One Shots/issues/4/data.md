- Some of inmates start a contest where they each tell a story and Greg to decides which story was the scariest. One by one they tell him stories about their own personal vision of the world. Greg tries to keep it together but with every story he listens to, he starts to lose grip of reality.
- The Joker tells a story about him murdering hundreds of people w/ Joker Venom until Batman and Robin try to stop him, but Joker beats them and kills Robin while Bats is paralyzed by Joker Gas.
- Greg can't decide who won, angering the inmates. When the power is restored and the Asylum is unlocked, they find the two dead guards and all the cells locked. They find an insane Greg, body is covered in scars w/ the names of the inmates he faced. He is called now an Arkham patient called The Jigsaw Man.
