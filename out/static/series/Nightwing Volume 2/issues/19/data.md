- Nightwing is in Bl√ºdhaven when hears about the quake in Gotham and goes help.
- Meanwhile Tad Ryerstad (thug turned shitty vigilante) struggles to find a cool name for himself that hasn't already been taken (decides on Nite-Wing).
- Nightwing finds several people in a bus trapped in a underground fissure, including a mother and her child named Kenny. They don't believe that all of them will be able to make it out alive before they drown in the flooding waters, but he manages to save but both and son.
- Already tired and sore, he appreciates his small victory and goes off to see where else he can help.
