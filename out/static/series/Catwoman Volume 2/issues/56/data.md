- Cats steals a pair of WayneTech binoculars (to help her in her next heist) from crowded Buddingdale's store.
- While she is sneaking in an elevator shaft, the quake hits.
- She crawls through the debris and sees a security guard helping an injured little girl (Elise) on the eighth floor. She tends to Elise while the guard searches for survivors.
- Elise dies, Cats is upset and feeling claustrophobic. She begins searching for a way out and finds a window she can look out from, but when she lays her eyes on Gotham, she is shocked to see that her entire city has been destroyed by an earthquake (they thought just the building was bombed or something).
- Cats returns, to the guard's surprise. Cats uses her whip to carry the survivors, one by one, across to the fire escape to another building that they can climb down from.
- Afterwards, Catwoman sits on the ledge of a building and mourns her city as it goes up in flame.
