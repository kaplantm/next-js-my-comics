- Two-Face and his followers are marching uptown. James Gordon and his men are making a grab for Penguin's territory and Penguin is attacking Batman's territory, defended by Batgirl.

- Penguins tell Batgirl to surrender, she refuses and shoots an arrow at his knee. Two-Face arrives and tells Penguin to leave as he has double-crossed Cobblepot. While Penguin was attacking Batman's place, Gordon has already seized Penguin's territory and Two-Face has done the same. Penguin and Batgirl are forced to leave, outnumbered and outmaneuvered by Two-Face’s.

- Batman is being held captive by a Russian woman called Echo. She is a mind reader and forces him to relive his parent’s death. After a while, she feels bad for him and leaves him alone. Batman escapes, only to discover his territory taken over by Two-face. Two Face’s gang used extreme violence to make the message clear: Batman lost to Two-Face.
