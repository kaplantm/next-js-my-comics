- In Gothamâ€™s Chinatown, Batman finds that several gang members frozen in ice. 
- A rival gang appears and attacks Batman; Batman defeats them and questions a man about the frozen victims. He says they were attacked by Mister Freeze. The man also tells Batman about Freeze's location near the power plant.
- Batman goes to the power plant, where they are burning stolen furniture to generate energy. Mr Freeze has an ice castle next to the plant.
- Mister Freeze is alone, remembering his deceased wife Nora Fries and how he holds Batman responsible for her death. Batman arrives and questions if Freezes wife, who was a kind woman, would like to see his action now.
- They fight. Eventually Mr. Freeze freezes Batman with the cold gun. Freeze thinks it is all over, but the castle starts to crumble. Batman sabotaged the powerplant before the fight, and it explodes. They both fall into the river. Freeze escapes.
