During the fight, Dava kisses Robin (transferring aramilla drug), also giving him super speed. They win the fight.\n- Shiva arrives and Robin attacks her, but accidentally gravely injures her due to his new speed.\n- Robin is worried about Lady Shiva and tells Dava to distract the military men and King Snake (allied w/ the general) while he tries to resuscitate her.\n- Outside, General Tvorakovich dies in an explosion that wasn't meant for him (something about a suitcase bomb?).\n- Suddenly Shiva wakes up ready for action.

Influenced by the drug, Shiva starts killing King Snake's men.\n- Robin takes an injured Dava out of the shack leaving Shiva and Snake in a duel.\n- Robin and Dava are near the forest when they are spotted by Dava's army, and she goes with them.\n- Tim takes a plane to Gotham City and calls his father on his way home, telling him theyâ€™ll be no more secrets between them, but the flight is diverted to Bludhaven as they fly over a destroyed Gotham.\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Cataclysm, Part Seven: Tribunal","start":"April, 1998","end":null,"issueNumber":52,"arc":"Batman: Cataclysm","link":"https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Robin_Vol_2_52"},"coverPath":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/comicassets.tonarie.com/Robin Volume 2/Robin_Volume_2_52_cover_400x621.jpg","imagePaths":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/comicassets.tonarie.com/Robin Volume 2/Robin Volume 2_IMG_0294_1091x433.jpeg","https://s3.amazonaws.com/comicassets.tonarie.com/Robin Volume 2/Robin Volume 2_IMG_0295_640x651.jpeg"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
