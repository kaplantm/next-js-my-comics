JLA followed the adventures of the Justice League of America and introduced a number of locations and characters including the Ultramarine Corps and the Justice League Watchtower.\n\nMany new characters joined the Justice League during this era, including Zauriel, Orion and Big Barda of the New Gods, Steel, Oracle, and Plastic Man. JLA also revived the tradition, going back to the Silver Age, of the League teaming up with the Justice Society every year, which gave rise to the [new JSA series](https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/JSA_Vol_1).\n","frontMatter":{"title":"JLA Volume 1","start":"1997","end":"2006","issue":null,"arc":null,"link":"https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/JLA_Vol_1"},"coverPath":null,"imagePaths":[]},"issues":{"32":{"params":{"series":"JLA Volume 1","issueNumber":"32"},"link":{"pathname":"/series/JLA Volume 1/issues/32","name":"#32 - Inside Job"},"comic":{"description":"\n\n- A criminal organization known as Locus takes advantage of the No Man's Land.
