Its deliberately geared toward new and 'casual' fans, the series consists almost entirely of self-contained stories - which may run anywhere from one to five issues - from a wide variety of creative teams. No two consecutive stories feature the same writer or artist(s).\n\nContinuity-wise, most of the stories are set in some nebulous period during Batman's early career (indeed, several of the early stories are direct followups to Batman: Year One), with no other costumed heroes active in Gotham City and James Gordon still holding the rank of captain. Few characters or events from the larger DC Universe are ever acknowledged.\n\nOverall, the series is ostensibly part of Batman's Post-Crisis history, but with very little concrete impact on subsequent stories or events (exceptions such as Venom usually being contributed by writers with authority on more continuity-heavy titles).\n\nOn four occasions the series participated in crossover storylines with other Batman titles:\n\n- Issue #27 participated in Destroyer.\n- Issues #59 through #63 participated in Knightquest and KnightsEnd.\n- Issues #116 through #126 participated in No Man's Land.\n- Issues #182 through #184 participated in War Games.\n\nThe series was discontinued in early 2007 with issue #214, and subsequently replaced by Batman Confidential (Volume 1).
