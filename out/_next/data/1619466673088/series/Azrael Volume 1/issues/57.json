Scratch agrees. \n- Meanwhile Batgirl goes around sneakily stealing most of the weapons from the group.\n- At dawn, when Scratch says it’s time for Azrael’s execution, they put the cowl on him. Jean-Paul transforms into Azrael and breaks free from the ropes tying him up. Azrael and Batgirl take down Scratch and his henchmen, also convincing the crowd that Scratch is not the savior they were promised. After the fight, they take medical supplies from Scratch’s cache back to Leslie.\n- Back at Leslie's, Jean-Paul confesses to her that he enjoyed the violence he used against Scratch and Leslie says it is only human to fall short of our best intentions. She then says, _“Come on, there are sick people who need our help...and take off that ridiculous costume.”_\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Scratched Out","start":"October, 1999","end":null,"issue":57,"arc":"Batman: No Man's Land","link":"https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Azrael:_Agent_of_the_Bat_Vol_1_57"},"coverPath":"https://d2lrr1dyn0ugge.cloudfront.net/Azrael Volume 1/57/B89AC399-F219-4888-BD72-AF718506468F_1_105_c_714x1099.jpeg","imagePaths":[]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
