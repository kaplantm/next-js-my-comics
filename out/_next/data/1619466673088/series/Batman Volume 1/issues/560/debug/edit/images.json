Scratch sends some of his minions (in devil masks - or uh, guess their DNA is modified too) to free Garfield Lynns (Firefly). They offer him a million dollars in order to create chaos in the city. \n- Scratch is a guest on a talk show and continues to explain that Gotham is hopeless.\n- At night, Batman visits a senator opposed to rebuilding Gotham, but a group of Scratch's henchmen break into the room and attack Batman. He is outnumbered and leaves before it escalates. \n- The next day, Bruce meets with some congress members, but they all seem to be against Gotham.\n- Scratch's minions inform their master they were unable to stop Batman, so he kills them all.\n- Later, Scratch leads another televised event against rebuilding Gotham.\n","frontMatter":{"title":"Mr. Wayne Goes to Washington, Part 1: The Jackals","start":"December, 1998","end":null,"issue":560,"arc":"Batman: Road to No Man's Land","link":"https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Batman_Vol_1_560"},"coverPath":"https://d2lrr1dyn0ugge.cloudfront.net/Batman Volume 1/560/Batman_560_400x620.jpg","imagePaths":["https://d2lrr1dyn0ugge.cloudfront.net/Batman Volume 1/560/80486A16-12E0-4379-8331-2146EDD22587_1_201_a_556x723.jpeg"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
