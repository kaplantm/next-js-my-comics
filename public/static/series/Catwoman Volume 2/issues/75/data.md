- Catwoman is floating in the East River after she was shot and left for dead by an unknown woman.
- She remembers her childhood: She had just run away from the orphanage, and she was pickpocketing at a carnival when the owner caught her and invited her to join. Selina began training in gymnastics, magic, and trickery, and she used those skills to become a better thief. One day, Del was deadly injured during a performance, but he smiled for the audience regardless. She wouldn't forget what Del told her that night: "Never let them see you cry. Never let them see you're hurt. Never."
- Catwoman swims out of the river and heads to Gotham to deliver the original discs to Batman.
- Elsewhere, Vincent Nastacio, leader of Hardcases Inc., receives a phone call from the hospital. Eddie Conway (other hardcase,  telepathic) came out of anesthesia long enough to report a vision of Catwoman in Gotham. 
- Catwoman hijacks one of the helicopters patrolling the Gotham skies, and she forces the pilot to take her to Gotham. Catwoman's pilot decides to crash the chopper. Catwoman emerges from the crashed helicopter, injured, just as Nastacio arrives. He tells her that she's coming with him, but Azrael steps in between Catwoman and Nastacio. Catwoman escapes the scene.
- Catwoman makes it to the cathedral to deliver the discs. Catwoman hands over the discs and hurries to leave when Batman shouts after her to take care of herself. She realizes he knows about her injury. Batman warns her that if she steals in Gotham, he'll take her down, and she replies, "Good. Come and chase me, Batman."
- Somewhere in Gotham, Catwoman feels sick, tired, and weak. The river water must have polluted her bullet wound. She tells herself to never let them see her hurt and never let them see her cry. She faints.
