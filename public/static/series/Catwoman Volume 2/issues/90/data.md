- Despite her injury (she was shot by Gordon accidentally as he was shot), Catwoman desperately races across the Gotham rooftops to escape the  vigilantes pursuing her.
- When the Batfamily finally captures her, she tells them that she saw Gordon's attacker - although she wouldn't be able to identify him, it was definitely a cop. She is even able to give them the location of the gun used to shoot the Commissioner, which she saw the cop in question hide
- The heroes find it and let Catwoman go, vowing to get the gun traced.
- Meanwhile, doctors perform surgery on Gordon.
