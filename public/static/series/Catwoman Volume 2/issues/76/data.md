- Selina wakes up at the Penguin’s hideout with no memory of how she got there. Penguin tells her that one of his henchmen found her unconscious and brought her in.
- Penguin wants Selina to do something for him, and she reluctantly agrees. Recently his activities have been threatened by Lex Luthor and his rebuilding efforts, and he wants her to steal from Luthor in order to balance the scales on his favor.
- Catwoman studies Lex's compound, and she realizes that she's going to need help to get inside. She discovers that her trio of henchmen are working for LexCorp now and she decides to recruit them again.
- She tries to steal an armored battlesuit from the compound, but she is apparently unable to make it work. A security camera records her, but the guards decide to let the armored guards take care of her.
- The armored guards try to stop Catwoman, but she was just pretending that she couldn't activate the suit. As soon as the guards are within her reach, she activates her suit and triggers the slave units in the guard’s suits, putting the guards in her control.
- Catwoman escapes the compound with a little help from Al and Lewis.
- Penguin is waiting at his hideout when Catwoman arrives with a dozen armored men carrying all sort of stolen goods from LexCorp--including a bulldozer, a power shovel, and other construction equipment. Penguin is pleased.
- Luthor receives the bad news when he arrives at the compound. He is angry at his people for their incompetence.
- Mercy passes Luthor a call from Penguin. Cobblepot acknowledges Luthor's reign over Gotham, but he demands control over the city's underworld or else he will send Catwoman to steal more. Luthor hangs up the phone and tells Mercy to get rid of Catwoman.
