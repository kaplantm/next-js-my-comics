- Catwoman is patrolling the city, stopping looters. At the WayneTech building she finds Poison Ivy and a scientist who has been secretly serving her as she spreads her special fertilizer across the city.
- Catwoman leaves them to it since it's none of her business, but as she's leaving, Ivy decides the scientist is no longer useful to her. Ivy gives him a poisonous kiss and walks away. Catwoman tries to save him, but it's too late.
- Catwoman and Ivy fight but Ivy easily gets away.
- Poison Ivy arrives at the GCPD and plants a seed on the street. Harvey Bullock tries to stop her and calls for backup. Ivy tries to fatally kiss him, but Catwoman stops her and Ivy runs.
- Her fertilizer is already working, a giant tree grows in front of GCPD. Catwoman and Bullock work together to rip the tree out by the roots.
- Catwoman searches for clues to where Ivy will strike next. She remembers Ivy's dead accomplice mentioning that WayneTech had already delivered their fertilizer across town, and she steals a list of delivery sites from his corpse.
- Catwoman finds Ivy at Reservoir Park.
- Ivy drops her hyperseeds into the water, which will carry them citywide. Cat jumps down and manages to catch the seed vial w/ her whip, but she is left hanging by one hand from the observation deck.
- Catwoman throws the vial at Ivy's face. She screams as the seeds start to sprout in her face, but she begs Catwoman to swear that she'll keep them growing even if it kills her. Cats takes Ivy to the GCPD, and she tells herself that Ivy will be fine and the city is safe.
