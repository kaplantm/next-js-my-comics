- Catwoman's henchman, are angry with her for letting Mookie sacrifice himself in an explosion. Catwoman reveals that Mookie is actually alive - he has a superpower, kinetic energy passes harmlessly through him. It does make him feel high, though, which is why he enjoys explosions so much.
- In Gotham City, Oracle still can't believe Batman trusts Catwoman even after she murdered Selina Kyle. Batman knows the truth behind that, but doesn't tell her. Instead he proposes scenarios to explain that its possible Catwoman never killed Selina Kyle.
- Oracle finds out Catwoman stole the discs, but is offering them to the highest bidder online. Batman isn't surprised.
- Elsewhere, Mercy Graves's employer tells her to buy those discs at any cost. He knows the discs might be copies of the originals, but that won't matter if Catwoman is dead.
- Maxi Zeus is also interested the discs, and he plans to steal them from Catwoman using information his henchman Mr. Mercury has learned from his sister's second cousin, Catwoman's henchman Al.
- At their headquarters, the Hardcases, Inc., use their abilities to learn of Catwoman's next step. They learn that she is going to make the trade with the buyer at the top of the World Trade Center at midnight.
- Catwoman and her crew are already at the World Trade Center. She tells her crew to stay on one tower and watch a package, which she says holds the discs, while she goes to make the deal on the other tower. 
- Al distracts Lewis, so only Mookie notices Maxie Zeus and his followers arrive. The Hardcases also make it there then and demand the discs in the name of their rightful owner, Bruce Wayne.
- A firefight breaks out. The Hardcases overpower Maxie Zeus's crew, and a Hardcase kicks the package out of Mookie's hands.
- The Hardcases find a tape instead of the discs inside the package, and Nastacio presses 'play' and listens to a recording of Catwoman telling him he fell for her bait. The real exchange is happening in a small vehicle impound under the Brooklyn Bridge. She tells them that if everything has gone right, she's already gone, but if something goes wrong... perhaps they can catch something.
- Catwoman and Mercy have already exchanged the packages. Catwoman opens the case Mercy gave her, and a blast of phosphorus temporarily blinds her as Mercy aims her gun. They fight.
- The Hardcases arrive, but Mercy easily takes them out. Catwoman is still blinded and tries to move herself out of the way, but she is shot by Mercy and falls into the East River.
- Mercy jumps into her car and calls her employer and to tell him that she has the discs, but Catwoman might have survived. Her employer tells Mercy to forget her because they have more important matters to deal with.
