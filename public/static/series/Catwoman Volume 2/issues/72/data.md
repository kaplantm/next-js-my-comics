- Catwoman learns about a valuable cat-gem on display in Manhattan. She steals the gem, but then it transforms into a communicator and a hologram of Oracle appears. Oracle tells her "the boss" will be waiting for her in Robinson Central Station Main Lobby in twelve hours. Then the gem vanishes, to Catwoman's annoyance.
- Catwoman finds her way into Gotham, evading US Marshalls and the navy. She is furious and determined to make Batman pay for what he did.
- She reaches Gotham's shore and is shocked to see her beloved city completely destroyed.
- She meets with Batman, who tells her he needs her to steal some computer discs that hold vital information for restoring Gotham. The discs are in Manhattan, where Catwoman just left. She's pissed. Batman argues that this conversation was too sensitive and had to be face-to-face, and he needed to be sure she could get in and out of Gotham.
- Catwoman demands to know why she should do anything for Batman. He answers, "I need you," and pulls her in for a kiss. Catwoman agrees, provided he find her an alternative route in and out of the city.
- Catwoman takes the old steam tunnel he recommends to her, which he believes is abandoned, but Catwoman finds herself up against the three henchman--Al, Lewis, and Mookie. They fight for a while, but when the henchman can't shoot her directly, Mookie shoots a crate of explosives. The tunnel beings to floods and they are all swept away by the water.
