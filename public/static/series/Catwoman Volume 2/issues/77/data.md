- Catwoman plans her revenge on the people she has dealt with lately. First, she destroys the LexCorp compound using the battlesuits she stole.
- Luthor contacts the Penguin to make a deal--if Penguin returns Luthor's stolen goods and gives him Catwoman's head, then Penguin will have free reign over Gotham's underworld activities.
- Penguin’s goons try to take her down, but she beat them and blows up his base.
- Luther tells Mercy to focus on killing Catwoman.
- Catwoman continues her rampage against LexCorp's building bases. Eventually reconstruction stops completely because of her activities.
- Luther decides to make a deal with Catwoman. At the meeting point, Luthor asks Catwoman what it will take to stop Catwoman from targeting his operation. She tells him all he has to do is ask and say please; Luthor hesitates, but grudgingly does so. Catwoman says that's the only thing she ever wanted (…and she gets to rub it in Mercy’s fail that she failed to stop her). She knew she couldn't take Mercy on physically, so she went after her where it hurt the most: her pride.
- Catwoman gathers her trio of henchmen. She gives Al and Lewis two passports and passbooks with a million dollars each in their accounts on the Cayman Islands. She then explains that she discovered why Mookie unharmed in explosions or when hit by bullets. Mookie is dead, and he has been ever since he was working for the Joker and his boss killed him. Ever since, he has gathered kinetic energy to create enough mass to make it seem as though he were alive. Mookie says it's all true.
- Deadman then appears to take Mookie to the other side. Mookie wasn't sure about it, but Catwoman tells him it will be fine. Mookie goes with Deadman, and both move to the afterlife.
- Catwoman leaves, knowing that word will get out and people will know that Catwoman takes care of her crew.
