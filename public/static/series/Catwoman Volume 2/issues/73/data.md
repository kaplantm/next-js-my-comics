- Catwoman and two of the men, Al and Lewis, reach a gate at the end of the tunnel. They work together to open it and are swept outside. 
- Catwoman threatens Al, Lewis and Mookie, forcing them to be her crew for this job.
- They travel to Manhattan. Unfortunately Selina is known as both Selina Kyle, dead mayoral candidate, and Catwoman, Selina Kyle's murderer, in New York, so they must disguise themselves. Mookie is dressed up as the Countess Angora while Selina becomes Miss Venite, her traveling companion and secretary, and Al and Lewis serve as their bodyguards.
- Selina studies the info Batman gave her. The discs she is going to steal were meant for Bruce Wayne, but after he was embarrassed in Washington, D.C., he took off to Europe and no one can find him to pick the discs up.
- The discs are protected by a new security group called Hardcases Inc. The organization comprises of ex-U.S. Armed Forces with low-level metahuman abilities. There are five members, each with a unique power and trained in different areas.
- The next day, Selina goes to the Jordan Building where she is confronted by Natasha White and Vincent Nastacio of the Hardcases. She pretends to be a Wayne Enterprises employee trying to pick up the discs, but Natascio tells her that only Bruce Wayne is allowed to see the discs.
- Selina claims she was only testing them because Wayne Enterprises has reliable information that Catwoman might try to steal the discs. She leaves, and Nastacio admires her moxie. He knows she's Catwoman, and while he doesn't understand why she warned them about her upcoming attack, he puts the building on full alert.
- That night, Al, Lewis and Mookie attack the Hardcases building to distract the vault guards from their posts.
- Catwoman sneaks to the vault and takes the disc.
- Nastacio watches her through the security cameras and says, "Good. You went for it." Later, Nastacio explains that he switched the discs in the vault for fake ones. But they soon discover his paln didn't actually work - Catwoman snuck back after Nastacio stopped watching the cameras and took the real discs.
- Nastacio say "We're going to find her, and the discs, and then nail her hide to the wall."
