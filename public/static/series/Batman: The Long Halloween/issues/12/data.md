- Harvey Dent has been missing for a month. Harvey is hiding in the sewers, having suffered a mental breakdown.
- On Labor Day, James Gordon and Batman discover that Harvey Dent was carrying a .22 gun and ledger of Falcone's names in his briefcase. They conclude that Dent is likely the Holiday killer. Gordon wants to find Harvey but Batman refuses to believe that Dent committed those crimes.
- Batman finds Carmine Falcone and asks him about Dent. Falcone doesn't know and he blames Batman and the police for the deaths of his family members.
- Batman confronts Catwoman about why she has been spying on him,  but she escapes without answering.
- Batman goes to Dent's house and finds Gilda Dent. She says she doesn't know husband's whereabouts. Batman tells her that Dent is Holiday and there is enough evidence to prove it. Gilda is worried and asks Batman to find "her" Harvey.
- Batman consults Calendar Man, who suggests that as Labor Day comes to an end, Holiday will likely kill.
- Sal Maroni has been in prison since the trial. As Maroni is being moved for his own safety, he is shot and killed.
- A guard approaches the shooter, and Holiday shoots him. Then Gordon grabs his flashlight and points it towards Holiday, revealing the killer's identity: Alberto Falcone.
