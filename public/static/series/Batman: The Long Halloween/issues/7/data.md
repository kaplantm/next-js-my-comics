- April Fool's Day, Carmine Falcone hires The Riddler to solve the mystery of the Holiday killer. Based on the size of the gun, Riddler suggests it might be a woman.
- Meanwhile in the Batcave, Batman investigates the evidence left at Holiday's crime scenes. He theorizes the killer could be Sal Maroni, since he benefits from the death of the Falcone empire. However, Alfred suggests that the killer might be someone who pursues justice a little too far. 
- Batman analyzes the possibility that James Gordon or Harvey Dent might be the holiday killer. In the end, he comes to the conclusion that Gordon couldn't have done any of the murders, but Dent could.
- At that moment, Dent and Gordon decide they will arrest Bruce Wayne for his involvement with Falcone and his dirty money.
- Falcone is tired of The Riddler's guesses. He demands an answer. The Riddler supposes the holiday killer is Falcone himself. The answer is so ludicrous that Falcone and Sofia laugh at him. When the Riddler leaves the building, Holiday shoots his gun several times near the Riddler, leaving behind the gun and his umbrella. Riddler wonders why Holiday didn't murder him.
