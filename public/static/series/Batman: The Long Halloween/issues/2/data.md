- It is Thanksgiving. GCPD in interrogates Mickey Sullivan (from "The Irish" gane) about the bombing at Dent's place, but he won't talk about who hired him. However, he tells them that Harvey Dent might be the man who murdered Johnny Viti. 
- Gordon sends Micky back to his cell. On the way there, the lights go down and when they come back, something changed in Mickey.
- Elsewhere, Carla Viti demands action for the murder of her son Johnny Viti. Carmine Falcone say that he has already taken care of it.
- Mickey tries to get his accomplices to just give up who hired then rather than give their rehearsed confessions, but they refuse. The gang confesses to the bombing without revealing who hired them.
- Later, Mickey is back in Gordon's office but this time, he pulls off his face and reveals that he is Harvey Dent in disguise. It was all planned between him, Gordon and Batman, in order to make the crew incriminate Falcone, but the plan failed.
- On Thanksgiving night, Harvey Dent spends the night at the hospital near his wife's bed. James Gordon arrives home late and misses Thanksgiving dinner. Batman brings dinner to Solomon Grundy.
- Meanwhile, in The Astoria Towers Hotel, Mickey and his gang (out on bail) are having dinner and celebrating in the name of "The Roman".
- Moments later, someone breaks into the room where Mickey and his gang are eating and shoots them all with a similar gun as the one used to kill Johnny Viti. The murderer leaves the gun and a cornucopia in the crime scene.
