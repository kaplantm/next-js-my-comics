- A criminal organization known as Locus takes advantage of the No Man's Land. They release Genanite spores into the population, which infect the bloodstreams of humans and transforms them into robotic drones.
- Superman monitors the situation from the Ionosphere while the Huntress is in the thick of things, trying to quell angry mobs and opportunists in Gotham. Huntress complains that the JLA doesnâ€™t have any members in Gotham, but Superman points out the that presence this is actually illegal right now, and also, they already do have members there - Batman and Huntress herself.
- The JLA begin tracking down carriers of the Genanite spores and the Martian Manhunter suspects that these drones may even exist within the halls of power in Congress.
- Orion and the Flash are both infected with the spores, but the JLA are able to treat them in time. Superman tracks down the architects behind Locus and tells them that the JLA will not cede Gotham to their whims.
