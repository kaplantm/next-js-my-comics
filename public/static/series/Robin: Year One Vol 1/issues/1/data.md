- Gotham underworld has heard about Batman's new sidekick.
- Alfred Pennyworth worries about Dick Grayson vigilante involvement, but the butler cannot deny the positive influence the lighthearted boy has on Bruce. 
- After attending a dinner party for Generalissimo Singh Manh Lee of Rheelasia, Batman and Robin meet Captain James Gordon who informs them about a string of kidnappings. 
- Behind the kidnappings is actually the Mad Hatter who has been enticing teenage girls with free headsets he uses to hypnotize them. His plan is to sell the captive girls to Generalissimo Singh Manh Lee.
- Dick sees the Mad Hatter kidnap a girl from his school. Because Bruce is attending another party at night - on the yacht of the Generalissimo - Robin decides to stop the villain on his own (with a little support by Alfred).
- Dick finds out that the Mad Hatter is delivering the girls to the Generalissimo on his yacht. Robin sneaks aboard, fights through a horde of goons, rescues the girls and exposes the Mad Hatter's plot. The General uses his diplomatic immunity to get away though. 
- Bruce is at first angry with Dick for going at the Mad Hatter alone, but he still is proud of his accomplishments.
