- Batman and Robin defeat several more would-be supervillains, such as the Cluemaster, Firefly, Killer Moth, and Blockbuster. Robin grows more and more confident with each victory, despite of Batman's warnings that Gotham's more elite criminals will not be so easy.
- Two-Face soon reemerges and kidnaps Lawrence Watkins, the judge who had permitted and presided over the appeal trial of mobster Vincent Moroni, during which Dent was scarred by acid. Two-Face's twisted logic holds Watkins responsible for "murdering" Dent. 
- Revenge on Watkins, is only a small part of Two-Face's goal; his main targets are Batman and Robin.
- The Dynamic Duo are eventually captured by Two-Face and forced into a mock trial. Two-Face declares them all guitly and places Batman and Watkins into a custom-built double gallows, and dares Robin to wager on a coin flip for their lives. Robin calls for neither man to hang if Two-Face's next two coin-flips both come up clean. Both flips land in Robin's favor, and Two-Face cuts Watkins free, only to reveal a trapdoor in the gallows that allows him to drown the judge instead.
- As Robin reels over Watkins' death, Two-Face savagely beats him with a baseball bat, all while Batman is forced to watch. An enraged Batman breaks his bonds and beats Two-Face and his men unconscious, before rushing the badly-injured Robin back to the Batcave.
