- Dick's new "mentor" turns out to be none other than Shrike, a member of the League of Assassins responsible for contracts in Gotham City. Under the name "Freddie Loyd", Dick trains alongside Shrike's other teenage mercenaries. Eventually, Shrike reveals their first genuine job will be the assassination of Two-Face.
- Shrike's "pupils" successfully find and invade Two-Face's latest hideout, but are stymied by Two-Face himself, who takes one of them hostage. Dick is once again dared to flip for an innocent life, but refuses; this causes Two-Face to fly into a rage, allowing Dick to knock him off-balance and steal his gun. Unable to stomach cold-blooded murder, Dick spares Two-Face and flees, leaving his would-be victim vowing revenge.
- Dick briefly returns to the Batcave and reports his findings in another letter, causing Batman - along with Two-Face - to scour the city for Shrike. Eventually, all parties converge inside Shrike's hideout, sparking a three-way battle that kills Shrike and gravely injures Batman. Upon finding himself outnumbered, Two-Face flees, while Batman reconciles with Dick.
- In following days, Dick returns to Wayne Manor and is allowed to continue as Robin, on the condition that he never again question Batman's orders. Dick agrees, and shortly after, the reinstated Robin finally brings Two-Face to justice.
