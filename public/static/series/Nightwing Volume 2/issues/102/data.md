- Dick travels to Metropolis to get advice from Superman about what to do now that he is no longer Robin.
- Unfortunately, they are interrupted by some terrorists targeting the president. They stop the perpetrators, but Dick has to think quickly and jumps off a building with a bomb in order to reduce casualties. However, Superman catches Dick and assures him that there is a fail-safe.
- Afterwards, Superman shows Dick his Fortress of Solitude and tells him the legendary story of Nightwing, a Kryptonian hero who was cast out of his family. Dick tells Superman that he briefly considered having a normal life, but he always thought he would become Batman one day.
- Meanwhile, in the Batcave, Batman reprimands Alfred for dusting the display case of the Robin suit, and states that there won't be any more sidekicks.
- Dick returns to Haly's Circus, where he stops some thieves. As Dick discusses performing again, Deadman enters.
