- Nightwing brings Barbara the gun that was used to shoot her father. She investigates and find the gun once belonged to the Lucky Hand Triad, part of a stash of weapons that was confiscated by Police. One of the two officers on the bust, Lowell and Rich, failed to report or hand in this gun, perhaps planning to use it as a 'drop gun' to plant evidence.
- She does more research and finds that officer Rich's real name is Jordan Reynolds, a former mafia member in Chicago, who was arrested years ago by James Gordon.
- At the St. Luke's Hospital, Alfred Pennyworth leaves Batman's employ, frustrated by his reaction to the shooting - simply waiting at Gordon's bedside, not making any effort to catch the man who shot him. 
- Gordon wakes for the first time since the attack.
- On the other side of the city, Nightwing hand over the gun to Harvey Bullock and hands him the gun and explaining evidence condemning Officer Rich.
