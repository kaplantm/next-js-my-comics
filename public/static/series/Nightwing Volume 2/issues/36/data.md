- The Trigger Twins are bringing Nightwing down to the hole where all the other inmates are being held. They try to check his suit for Batarangs or any other weapon, but the suit protection system shocks them. They are mad and kick Nightwing while he is down and then they throw him into the hole.
- After a while, Nightwing recovers and he realizes that he is surrounded by all of the Blackgate inmates. They attack, and he has to fight all of them at once. He uses acrobatics to reach the ceiling bars where he looks for a way out, but  KGBeast forces him down again. 
- Scarecrow talks to the inmates and says Nightwing's presence might be helpful for them. Garfield Lynns opposes that idea and wants to kill Nightwing as revenge for his burned skin. Black Mask is in favor of keeping Nightwing alive and so the inmates are divided into two groups and they start to fight each other.
- Meanwhile in Bludhaven, Chief Redhorn offers Nite-Wing the chance to work for him as his personal vigilante and Nite-Wing accepts. 
- Elsewhere, Blockbuster is looking at the options for his heart transplant and when his mother listens to what is happening, Blockbuster tells her the truth. She is devastated.
- Back in Blackgate, the Ventriloquist convinces the inmates Nightwing is their best option for getting out of there.
- Lock-Up and his men are worried for Nightwing's presence and they search the prison looking for Batman, but obviously donâ€™t find him, which they find concerning.
- Lock-Up tries to speak to Nightwing down in the hole, but The Mad Hatter tells him Nightwing is dead. Lock-Up is convinced and Nightwing's plan is working. 
- The inmates are gathered around Nightwing awaiting the next step of the plan. Nightwing notices that the walls are filled with gunpowder (cellar was used for weapons storage). Nightwing tells the prisoners to collect the gunpowder, hoping to using it to blow up a wall.
- Lock-Up is really worried about Batman showing up, and worries the prisoners will escape to undeserved freedom. Lock-Up decides that it is time to sentence all of them to death.
