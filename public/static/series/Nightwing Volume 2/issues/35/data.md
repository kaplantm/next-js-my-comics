- Lock-Up has been running Blackgate Penitentiary since the beginning of No Man's Land. He has allied with KGBeast and the Trigger Twins to control the inmates.
- As the prison filled up with criminals, Batman fears that they might realize their combined power. Batman asks Nightwing to take control of Blackgate. Nightwing complains at first but after listening to Bruce's reasoning, he accepts the challenge. 
- Nightwing contacts Oracle to get some info before going in. Together they form a plan, Nightwing will infiltrate Blackgate in disguise as a similar looking janitor, Clyde Greenlaw. Nightwing sneaks into Blackgate.
- Meanwhile in Bludhaven, police have captured Nite-Wing and are questioning him. Chief Redhorn seems to sympathize with Nite-Wing's motives.
- In Blackgate, Nightwing find Greenlaw and tell him he is taking his place but Greenlaw doesn't like the idea leaving the prison. Greenlaw starts screaming and runs away from Nightwing. The noise alerts the Trigger Twins of Nightwing's presence and they start shooting at him.
- Nightwing manages to escape them but he comes across KGBeast and takes him down. Suddenly, he receives an electric shock from behind, knocking him out by Lock-Up.
