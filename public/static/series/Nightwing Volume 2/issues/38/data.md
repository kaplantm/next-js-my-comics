- Dick Grayson wakes up from a dream in which he was diving in the air along with Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. He wakes up in Barbara’s bedroom, she is taking care of him after he appeared in her apartment in a bad state after retaking Blackgate.
- Outside of the Clock Tower; Petit and his are planning to break in, knowing that somehow Barbara is a hub of info for the Blue Boys. But the building is filled with surveillance and traps, so they must try multiple approaches.
- Some of Barbara's monitors show alarms in different zones but she disregards them as she is confident that her traps will work fine and that she will start worrying when the alarm of zone 12 is activated.
- Barbara and Dick talk about their relationship, although Barbara tries to avoid the subject. She tells him that in order to move forward after his recent disability, she has to let go of things that made her happy like walking, skating, feeling with her legs and ultimately, she has to let go of Dick. He tells her that it doesn't matter to him as she starts crying. She tells Dick to five her some time. Dick agrees and tells her that he missed her.
- Apparently they didn’t need that much time though because they end up kissing, up until the zone 12 (roof) is activated and the men at the front door cause a big explosion. Dick takes his domino mask and grabs his escrima sticks.
- The men break inside the main room. Nightwing knocks out two of Pettit's men and then tells the former police officer that he stepped over the line this time. Nightwing is very angry and tells Pettit that he better call for reinforcements - but they already did, Huntress is with them.
