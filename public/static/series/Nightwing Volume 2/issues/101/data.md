- Robin is late to aid Batman in fighting Clayface, who is after a baby. Robin leads Clayface out into the snow, freezing him. While Batman and Robin argue about Robin's tardiness, Clayface thaws, then aims a gun at them, but it backfires. However, Clayface runs off and Robin chases him into a sewer. There, Clayface almost defeats Robin, but gets washed down by an open pipe.
- Batman returns the baby, which happens to be Clayface's child, to its mother who was involved in a domestic dispute.
- When the duo returns to the Batcave, Alfred gives Robin a new suit, but Batman rebukes Robin, firing him for not being devoted enough. Fuming, Robin walks away, leaving the new suit behind.
