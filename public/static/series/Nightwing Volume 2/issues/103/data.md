- Dick walks around the circus, remembering his past. Lorna shows him an old poster of his dad in a suit similar to Deadman's, which he is surprised to see.
- Multiple times, he is approached by someone who knows his secret identity, leaving him unsettled.
- Meanwhile, Alfred has been inquiring about the whereabouts of Dick. When he goes into the Batcave, he is shocked to see a young boy tied up. Batman explains that he caught Jason Todd trying to steal the Batmobile's tires, and has not decided whether to keep him or not.
- Dick puts on a blue version of his father's costume and starts practicing his act. However, a lion breaks loose and Dick holds it off until a tranquilizer dart puts it to sleep.
- Later, Dick is making some new Batarangs when Deadman appears, possessing Cleveland's body. He tells Dick that his father would be proud of him, then leaves to the Batcave. There, Deadman reports that Dick isn't coming back. Just then, Jason interrupts, wearing the new Robin suit.
