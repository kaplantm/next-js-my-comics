- Batgirl hears the news that Commissioner Gordon has been shot and critically injured. 
- She hears that Catwoman is a suspect and tries to track her down.
- The last is Gothamview Tower in Midtown, and it seems that Catwoman does indeed live here, though she's not at home. Batgirl activates a trap, and she has to evade the net, bear pit and tranq darts, only to find herself under attack from Slyfox and his gang, there to settle a score with Catwoman. Batgirl fights them off, trapping Slyfox in the bear pit with a broken leg.
