After the explosion, Batman searches the rubber. He finds Sheila near to death. She tells Batman what happened with the Joker and before dying, she regrets her actions but is proud of Jason. 
Batman finds Jason’s body.
Meanwhile, the Joker makes a deal with the leaders of the Iranian Government.
Before leaving, however, Batman examines the Joker's hideout and finds a message written on the wall telling him where to meet him - the United Nations Building in New York City.
Back in Gotham, only four people — namely Bruce, Alfred, James Gordon and his daughter Barbara — attend the funeral of Jason Todd and Sheila Haywood.
Batman goes to meet the Joker at a UN meeting. Superman appears and tries to persuade Batman to leave in order to prevent an international incident. Batman punches him in the face. The Joker arrives and reveals that he is the new ambassador of the Iranian Government to the U.N. and thus, he can't be punished by any of his past crimes due to the diplomatic immunity. 
Batman watches in disbelief as his greatest foe stands in front of him, mocking him after killing Jason.
