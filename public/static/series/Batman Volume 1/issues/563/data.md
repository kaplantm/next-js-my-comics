- Cops from GCPD are in Street Demonz territory spraying a false tag, but things get out of hand and they end up killing two gang members. This only serves as fodder for the gang war tho, and the gangs do begin killing each other off. 
- Near the Gotham River, three gang members see a lone, old, drunken man. They confront him and bring him to the top of a bridge, telling him that he is going to be swimming out of No Man's Land (their boss wants to know if there are mines in the river). Before they can push the man in he starts to fight back, but he is pushed over the edge anyway. 
- Suddenly, Batman drops in on them. The old man, who is revealed to be Alfred Pennyworth, was caught on the edge of the bridge by his coat. 
- One of the gang members falls into the river, turns out there are mines. 
- Batman apologies for being late. Besides that, their recon mission was successful, and now Bats knows about the mines and that someone is trying to bring something in or out of Gotham. 
- The next day, Batman calls Oracle and tells her he is back. She asks about the Batman tags but he says it's not him. 
- Day 102, Blue Boys take the Demonz territory, were Oracle was staying. The Gordon family reunites.
- In Batgirl's territory, Batman confronts her. He lets her continue as long as she doesn't disgrace the symbol. He too will begin tagging territory.
