- Bruce Wayne goes to DC to promote Gothamâ€™s reconstruction.
- Scratch decides he must prove to the country that trying to save Gotham is futile. Scratch sends some of his minions (in devil masks - or uh, guess their DNA is modified too) to free Garfield Lynns (Firefly). They offer him a million dollars in order to create chaos in the city.
- Scratch is a guest on a talk show and continues to explain that Gotham is hopeless.
- At night, Batman visits a senator opposed to rebuilding Gotham, but a group of Scratch's henchmen break into the room and attack Batman. He is outnumbered and leaves before it escalates.
- The next day, Bruce meets with some congress members, but they all seem to be against Gotham.
- Scratch's minions inform their master they were unable to stop Batman, so he kills them all.
- Later, Scratch leads another televised event against rebuilding Gotham.
