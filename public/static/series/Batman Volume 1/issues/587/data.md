- It's Commissioner Gordon's birthday, and the GCPD throw him a party at the local pub. After kindly receiving gifts from his officers, Gordon reveals he has brought gifts for them, himself, as well. He give out handcuff keys, explaing his reasoning: the key is a powerful symbol of Police Officers unique responibility and power: to remove someone's freedom.
- Meanwhile, Batman patrols with his police radio to make sure the party is not interrupted.
- Later, Gordon leaves the pub, and see Catwoman in the alley outside. Several shots ring out, and a confused Gordon hits the ground with three bullets in his back.
