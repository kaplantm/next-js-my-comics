- Ra’s needs help. One of his scientists (Striss) went rogue and made a deadly plague formula. He asks the Dark Knight to find and stop Striss from spreading the plague and save Ra's daughter, Talia, who went after the scientist, unaware of the dangers.
- Batman investigates a chemist (Mr. London), who may have helped Striss. But Striss and Talia are already there and long gone. He gets a tip that they went to the Louisiana swamps. 
- He finds a secret base, and stops Talia from killing Striss (she thought Striss killed Ra’s, he was just knocked out).
- Batman fights Striss. In the fight, a vial of formula is spilled, killing Striss. They seal the room so plague can’t spread.
- Batman and Talia away and Ra’s doctors make sure they’re safe. Talia kisses Batman. He thinks she is beautiful, but her willingness to kill unnerves him.
