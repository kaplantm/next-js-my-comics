- At Wayne Manor, both Dick and Alfred are perturbed by Tim's apparent knowledge of Batman's secret identity. Tim explains that he was a witness to the death of Dick's parents at Haly's Circus. After seeing news footage of Dick as Robin repeating his quadruple somersault, Tim easily deduced the identities of his idols.
-  Tim says Batman needs a Robin, he has gone off the deep end since the death of the second robin. Tim pleads with Dick to return to being Robin.
- Elsewhere in Gotham, Batman and Two-Face have each set up a trap for their opponent. Batman has provided 22 million dollars as bait, while Two-Face has kidnapped a pair of twins. They both eventually abandon their posts to take the other's bait.
- Batman follows clues to find the kidnapped twins tied up on the top of the Hawk Bridge over the Twin Rivers. While saving the boys, he accidentally calls one of them Jason, and is horrified. 
- At Club Gemini, Two-Face easily finds his way to the 22 million dollar prize, but flips his coin over whether or not to take it.
- Dick doesn't want to go back to being Robin, but agrees to help Batman. Tim complains that Batman needs Robin, and not Nightwing. Alfred implies that perhaps Tim is meant to be the next Robin.
- Later, Batman regrets allowing Two-Face to escape, despite saving the twins. Two-Face regrets having left the money at Club Gemini. He devises another plan to kill the Batman.
