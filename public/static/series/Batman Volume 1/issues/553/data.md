- In the quake, skyscrapers crumble and fall into each other, hundreds of deaths. Gas mains explode and there are massive fires.
- Gordon is trapped in the wreckage at GCPD Headquarters.
  -Barbara Gordon rolls into the headquarters, drawing attention by firing a pistol in the air. She takes control of the situation and starts organizing the police officers in the rescue efforts.
- Harvey Bullock calmly walks in with a pipe rammed halfway through his arm and pulls it out with his teeth. Then Bullock rescues Gordon from the wreckage.
- Wayne Manor was destroyed... it was the only Wayne Enterprises building not quake-proofed because of the cavern network underneath it. Batma digs himself and Alfred out of the rubble, but they are still trapped in the cave. Batman start swimming through underground streams to get to the city. Then the aftershock hits.
