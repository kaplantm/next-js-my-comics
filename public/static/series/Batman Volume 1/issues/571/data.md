- Bane kills some street punks, leaving one girl alive - he needs a “sacrificial lamb” to test the a hidden basement vault for traps. Luckily they had all already been triggered by other intruders, and the girl lives. The vault (created by Lex Luthor) has weapons and ammunition. They take as much as they can carry.
- Bane then goes around killing gang members and leaving behind Ace of Spades cards to frame Two-Face.
- Penguin's henchmen tell him about the killings and cards, but Penguin realized someone might be trying to frame Two-Face. He calls Batman.
- Angered gangs start attacking Two-Face. Two-Face fights back.
- Batman and Robin arrived at Penguin's place and he tells them the situation. Penguin shows them the pattern of attacks formed across the Gotham map leaded to the Hall of Records. The duo moved out to check if Penguin's info was true.
- Bane arrives at the Hall of Records and sees some of Two-Face's people guarding the place. The girl asked Bane what was his plan and he told her that he was going to blow the entire building to permanently destroy Gotham's history.
