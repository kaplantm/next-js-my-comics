- Batman and his team are shocked to see Ra's coming after them. Talia explains about the pit, it increases his strength but causes a fit of madness. They try and fail to stop Ra’s. Talia gets away with Ra’s. 
- Ra’s flees to a desert hideout. He tells Talia the pit may no longer work on him after so many uses, needs to accelerate his plan to cleanse the world.
- Batman (alone) shows up. Ra’s, respecting Batman, challenges him to a duel. It’s a long fight and a dead tie, until Bats is stung by a deadly scorpion. Ra’s leaves him to die but Talia kisses him, transferring a secret antidote.
- Batman comes back to fight again. Ra’s is shocked and doesn’t fight back (recognizing Batman as superior?). Batman turns Ra’s in to authorities, but not Talia, kissing her before parting.
