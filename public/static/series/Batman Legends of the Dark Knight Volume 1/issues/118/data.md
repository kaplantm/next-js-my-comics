- Alfred is invited to Leslie Thompkin's refugee center to tell some stories to the kids.

- Alfred tells a story about a squire and a gallant knight who would fight for his kingdom until a cataclysm devastated his castle and homeland, forcing the knight to leave the kingdom and leaving the squire behind. Alfred was speaking of course of Batman, Gotham City, the earthquake that devastated Gotham and his story as well.

- Alfred tells about the squire's adventures and how he helped the people in the devastated kingdom until the knight came back. As Alfred tells them about the time when the squire tried to fight evil like the knight, he remembers when he was almost killed by some crooks before the Knight arrived back to save him.

- Alfred then finishes the story, then leaves and goes to the Batcave, where Batman was waiting for him and says from that point on, Two-Face has their undivided attention.
