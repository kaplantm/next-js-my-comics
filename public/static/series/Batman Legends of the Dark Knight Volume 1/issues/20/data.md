- Slaycroft's son, Tim, now a brainwashed solider, attacks Batman. Porter intervenes before he is killed, expelling that Batman is worth more as a test subject than a corpse. 
- Porter imprisons Batman in a cell that will fill in water in 24 hours, which he can only escape by lifting an 800lb door. Porter knows that is how Batman failed to save Porter's daughter at the start of all this, so assumes Batman will not be able to do so without taking the drugs he offers.
- By the way, Alfred got away from the shark hostage situation earlier - is padded out on a boat until he found another ship. He tried to have Gordon call in help to Santa Prisca but Gordon can't - it might start a war.
- General Slaycroft turns on Porter, tiring him to a chair and threatening him with a knife, demanding his research notes. He claims Porter has become unreliable (Porter has been taking his own drugs).
- Batman doesn't give in and take the pills. Instead he looses from stones from the prison walls to make a weighted bully system to move the door. He escapes the cell.
- Batman stops Slaycroft's interrogation. But Porter, cleverly plays back parts of the interrogation recording to play Slaycroft commanding "you want to kill me". This triggers Tim to kill his own father. Tim is upset by this and cries, despite his brainwashing.
- Porter is taken into custody, but later dies due to withdrawal form his own drug.
