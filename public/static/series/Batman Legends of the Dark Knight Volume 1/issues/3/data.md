- Bruce starts looking around the crime scene and discovers that some of the tribal artifacts in the exhibition had been taken. Suddenly, Bruce is attacked with an arrow that he manages to catch before it reaches him but he is unable to find the shooter.
- Batman does some more investigating, ends up fighting more cultists but no more answers. Bruce decides that he should talk to Spurlock about his investigations on the Alaskan tribes.
- The next day, Bruce visits Spurlock at the Gotham University. Spurlock does his best to explain the cult of Chubala, but suddenly Spurlock is killed with an arrow in the back. Bruce dodges a second arrow and he finally sees the murderer, a man dressed in native Alaskan clothes and wearing a tribal bat mask.
- That night, Bruce has self-doubts caused by his inability to catch the killer. He thinks about dropping the Batman business, but Alfred talks him out of it. Alfred suggests Bruce to follow his instincts and Bruce realizes that there must be a connection between the killer and the tribes in Otter Ridge, Alaska.
- Bruce decides to go back, but the whole place has changed. It is now is a big city full of tourists. The shaman that saved is now old drunk man who performs sacred dances for tourists spare change.
- The Shamanâ€™s granddaughter is extremely mad at Bruce as she blames him for all the damage done by Spurlock and his supposed "investigations". She tells Bruce how Spurlock stole the sacred artifacts from the shaman and forced him to reveal the secret stories of their tribes. Bruce is upset about the situation and wants to repair the damage done but it is too late.
- While they are driving to the lodge, a car appears out of nowhere and forces their car off the roadside cliff and into a freezing lake.
