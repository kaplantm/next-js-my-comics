- In a warehouse, two men torture a third, interrogating him about a missing shipment of drugs. As they are dousing their captive with lighter fluid, they hear music.
- One of the torturers goes to check out the music but never returns. The other torturer follows, but it suddenly killed by another man, who then sets the captive ablaze.
- There are more strange killings. A mobster named Jack Kane phones another criminal, Ottavio, that Mr. Whisper has returned and is killing members of the mob. He is then killed.
- Members of the mob gather and decide they need help against Mr. Whisper. They DIY an upside-down Bat-Signal, calling Batman.
