- Batman returns to the Batcave and studies the blueprint before he decides to follow the last clue, given to him by Morgenstern, and goes to the industrial district. Inside a warehouse, Batman finds several bodies hanging from the ceiling. Whisper surprises Batman, attacking and managing to capture him.
- With Batman trapped, Whisper tells the story of how the deal with the devil prevented him from dying, but gave him enough time to come up with a plan to cheat the devil. Whisper managed to trap his soul inside a cord, which removed his shadow. Then, developed a deadly plague and a way to trap it in glass. He hid his soul cord in the foundations of Gotham Cathedral and used the plague glass to decorate the place. When the church-bell shatters the glass on May Day, it will kill most of the people in Gotham. Whisper intends to offer the Devil all the victims' souls in exchange for his, allowing him to live forever.
- Before leaving, Whisper then lights a candle and tells Batman that when the candle goes out a chain reaction will crush his skull, killing him.
