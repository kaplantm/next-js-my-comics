- Batman returns to Wayne Manor.
- Hugo Strange continues to play-act his own "Batman" identity, but quickly sobers when he nearly falls off the edge of his penthouse; embittered by his physical shortcomings.
- Strange and Bruce Wayne attend a dinner party hosted by Mayor Klass. Strange continues to extol his theories about Batman, only to be repudiated by the mayor's strong-willed daughter Catherine. 
- As the week wears on, Strange redoubles his efforts to unravel Batman's psyche and true identity. A warrant for Cardona's arrest is soon issued, allowing Cort and his men to stake out Cardona's brownstone in hopes of ambushing Batman. All this worries Gordon.
- Batman - having wiretapped the brownstone long before - avoids the ambush, but nevertheless acknowledges to Gordon the taskforce's growing threat. Batman hunts down and apprehends Cardona as a peace offering to Cort, however he is upset at being "upstaged”, sparking another shootout that Batman barely escapes.
- Cort catches Gordon installing the bat signal, and then searches his office for proof he is withholding evidence form Strange’s investigation. Cort brings the files to Strange himself.
