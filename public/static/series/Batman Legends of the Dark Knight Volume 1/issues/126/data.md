- Not everyone is happy with the reopening of the city. Joker is thinking of something to make himself the center of attention. Joker realizes that he can strike near the opening day of Gotham to make it much more dramatic. 
- Batman is worried - Joker has disappeared from the map, which means he is plotting something.
- Meanwhile, at William Pettit's territory, he commands his people to stay in their base during Christmas eve and threatens their lives if they leave. It is clear now that Pettit is unstable.
- With their Headquarters reopened, the GCPD is back in action and James Gordon is reinstated as Police Commissioner. Montoya is promoted to detective second grade. 
- On Christmas Eve, the people of Gotham are having the traditional Christmas dinner. The Gordons are at Barbara's place, Montoya and Bullock are at the Montoya's place, Tim Drake and his father have returned to Gotham and are at their old place while Bruce, Dick, Alfred and Leslie are staying at one of Wayne Enterprises buildings.
- Pettitâ€™s camp is attacked during Christmas dinner. Pettit tells everyone to stand and fight but Huntress tries to tell them that it is a trap. Outside the camp, Joker along with Harley Quinn have just killed the guards and are calling the rest of them to come out.
