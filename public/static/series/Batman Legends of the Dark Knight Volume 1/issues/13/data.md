- After a disastrous dinner-date with Catherine Klass, Hugo Strange retreats to his penthouse and reconvenes with Sgt. Cort to discuss their next move against Batman. Strange has been physically and demographically profiling Batman, and Strange's key hypothesis is that Batman is driven by trauma from some recent crime.
- Strange uses hypnotherapy and an armor-like costume to mold Cort into a new, violent, vigilante called theÂ Night-Scourge. Strange exploits this rising tide of anti-vigilante sentiment, accusing Batman of inspiring the Night-Scourge.
- Batman finds Strange's campaign taking a heavy toll on his psyche.
- Batman chances upon the Night-Scourge's attacking Catwoman and saves her - although she strikes his for the unasked-for rescue. The Night-Scourge is unnerved by the encounter; he flees to Strange's penthouse. There, a fresh session of hypnosis coaxes him into obedience and a new costume: Strange's own homemade Batsuit.
- Shortly after, "Batman" invades Mayor Klass's home and kidnaps Catherine, demanding amnesty from the horrified mayor in exchange for her return.
