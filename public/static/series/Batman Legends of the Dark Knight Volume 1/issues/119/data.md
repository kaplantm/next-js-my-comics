- Two-Face and Penguin strike a deal. Two-Face agrees to give Penguin Batman's territory, freeing Two-Face to expand west, into GCPD territory. Batgirl calls Oracle and asks for info on Batman's behalf, but Oracle tells Batgirl she will only speak to Batman. Later, Batman shows up at Oracle's apartment and tells him something is brewing at City Hall but it might be a trap.

- Gordon tells his men that they are going to take Penguin's territory, even knowing that they don't possess the manpower to do it by themselves. Gordon asks something of Renee Montoya; something that they both are not proud of, but in the end Renee agrees and does as Gordon asks.

- Batman goes to City Hall where he finds a group gathered to watch a fight. Rhino is fighting a wisp of a woman (she was paid off by Two-Face). While Batman stops the fight, Two-Face, Penguin and Gordon's men all attack each other's territories. Batman save the woman, but then she knocks him unconscious.
