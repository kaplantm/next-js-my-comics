- Batman and Gordon mope and talk about their relationship in Gordonâ€™s garden.
- Jim felt abandoned when No Man's Land was declared and Batman was gone. He also tells Batman that he doesn't like the lack of respect towards him as he never told him about his plans, and disappearing act is quite rude.
- Batman is feeling bad for Jim and wants to give him something in return. Batman takes off his cowl and wants to reveal his true identity to Gordon, but the former commissioner closes his eyes and refuses to see the man behind the mask. Gordon tells him that if he wants to know his identity he would already have discovered and also hinted that perhaps he already knows it.
