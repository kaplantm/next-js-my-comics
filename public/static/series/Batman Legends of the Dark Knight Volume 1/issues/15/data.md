- Batman stays in the solitude of the Batcave, for several days to reaffirm his purpose and heal his psyche. Meanwhile, the Night-Scourge has free rein over Gotham; and Strange publicly threatens to reveal Batman's secret identity.
- Batman contacts Gordon and asks for one last chance to prove his innocence.
- He then confronts Strange, who is dressed in a Batman costume; Strange gloats that he has defeated Batman, only to be confused when Batman claims 1) that he never dreams and 2) that his parents are alive in Paraguay. This undermines Strange's confidence in his analysis of Batman.
- Gordon and a police officer then storm the apartment, having overheard Strange confessing to his plans, and discovering the Mayor's daughter. GCPD tries to arrest Strange but he flees. Before he can escape, he encounters the anti-vigilante taskforce, who mistake him for Batman and shoot him. He falls into the river.
- Batman hunts Max Cort, who is preparing to resume his activities as the Night Scourge; the two fight, and are evenly matched until Catwoman appears and disarms Cort to return the debt she owes Batman for previously saving her from Cort. Batman overpowers Cort, who flees to police headquarters; Batman pursues him the new Batmobile
- On arriving at headquarters, his fellow officers realize he is the Night-Scourge. Batman and Gordon reveal Cort's role in Strange's plan. Cort draws a gun and tries to shoot Batman, but is killed by his fellow officers.
- The Mayor orders the disbanding of the anti-vigilante taskforce; while Batman is still not officially endorsed, he nevertheless is trusted more by the authorities and people of Gotham.
- Gordon reveals that Strange's body was never found.
