- Batman goes to Gordon and warns him that Porter and Slaycroft want him to kill him. Batman says he will try to handle them that night, but if he fails, passes the responsibility to Gordon.
- Batman attacks Porter and Slaycroft, but they distract him with more drugs, so he fails. Disappointed in himself, he calls Alfred and asks him for help - to lock him in the batcave to detox.
- Porter and Slaycroft, awake that Gordon is on their trail, fly to Santa Prisca to lie low. Then continue testing this drugs on the General's son, Tim, turning him into a dumb but strong and obedient soldier.
- After six months, Bruce is recovered and becomes the bat again.
