- Six months later, two GCPD officers stumble upon the Chubala Cult in the middle of a human sacrifice. One is killed and the other barely escapes. Gordon and Batman check out the scene.
- Bruce tries to find the connection between the cult and the woman who stabbed herself. He attends an Alaskan Exhibition, he meets Dr. Madison Spurlock, an anthropologist. Bruce had told Madison the Native American folk tale that he learned while recovering in Alaska and this knowledge allowed Spurlock to gain notoriety, although he has been spreading the lie that he learned the tale from natives. At the exhibit, Bruce also meets Spurlock's assistant, Bennet Young.
- That night, Batman stops some cultists from finishing off the surviving officer. In the cultists pocket he find a strange substance that was seemingly drugs. He sets up a lab and examines it at Wayne Manor. Realizing Batman needs a base of operation, he explores the caverns below the manor the next morning.
- He receives a phone call from Spurlock's assistant, Bennet Young. Bruce goes to the exhibit to meet with him, but when he arrives, he finds Bennet Young with a spear sticking out of his chest. His dying words are "Baat... Man..."
