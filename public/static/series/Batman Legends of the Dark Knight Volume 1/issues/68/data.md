- During a harsh thunderstorm in Gotham City, Batman comes face to face with Joker, who is once again holding Councilwoman Elizabeth Kenner hostage. 
- A flashback shows Joseph Kerr and Rebecca Brown on vacation. He is so happy about Rebecca's acceptance of his proposal that his happiness seems almost like lunacy. 
- Joseph sees Batman's picture in a newspaper with the story proclaiming his return. Joseph leaves, jumps into a river which washes him downstream. When he comes out of the water, the Joker persona has once again taken over him completely.
- Present day, Joker now has Kenner on a boat, speaking to her as if they are lovers going on a honeymoon. Batman catches up to them in his own ski-boat. Joker proclaims that Batman will not take him down and will not take Rebecca away from him, a statement that confuses himself.
- Batman tells Joker to give up Kenner. At first, he refuses, but suddenly sees Rebecca's face instead for a split second and finally gives her up to the police chopper.
- Joker has his boat wired to explode in thirty seconds and tries to leave with his jet pack, but Batman grabs onto him. Unfortunately for both men, the jet pack runs out of gas, and the two are caught in the explosion. Batman is able to grab an unconscious Joker as well as a helicopter ladder, which takes them to safety.
- Joseph Kerr is proclaimed missing and presumed dead with no body having ever been found, leaving Rebecca sad and grieving for the love of her life, Joker is locked up in Arkham Asylum.
