- Batman is still using Porter's drug to improve his strength. But he is acting strangely. He's been patrolling with violent impudence, without the Batsuit - "It just doesn't feel comfortable anymore". Alfred accuses him of being ashamed to wear the suit.
- Batman goes to pickup more pills from Porter. A man (General Slaycroft) l is there, discussing a plan with him. After Batman leaves, Porter says "Another week and he's ours."
- On his way out, Batman impulsively attacks a kid - turns out its General Slaycroft son, who was just waiting for his dad.
- Batman does more patrolling. He's again too violent, yet he is still unable to avoid a man being shot and killed.
- Batman stops in at GCPD. Apparently he hasn't talked to Gordon in a while. He ironically comments on Gordon's nicotine addiction.
- Alfred quit! Bruce has been treating him like shit and doing vigilante things Alfred doesn't support.
- Batman goes to get more pills. He learns that Slaycroft has been funding Porter to create these drugs to use for creating improved soldiers. They were using Batman as an experiment.
- They demand Batman kill Gordon to earn more drugs.
