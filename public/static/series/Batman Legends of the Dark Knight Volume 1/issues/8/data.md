- Bruce Wayne goes back to his old childhood school and find a recording of Winchester's poetry tapes.
- Back in the Batcave, Batman analyzes the recording and learns it was created somewhere in Austria. However, the tape switches that of Thomas Wayne and Bruce Wayne, many years ago. The voice of Thomas talks about Lake Dess and Batman deduces that this fortunate mix-up has given him the location to learn the secret of Mr. Whisper.
- At that moment, the mob boss Morgenstern starts to take over the Gotham Organized Crime and he is glad to see Batman leaving Gotham in the Batgyro (helicopter).
- Batman arrives to Austria and goes to an old monastery near Lake Dess in order to ask for directions. The Abbot helps Batman, and tells him the story of an ancient monk called Manfred, who fell into temptation and led an entire monastery into a sinful path. Legend has it, Manfred struck a deal with the devil and surrendered his soul in exchange for 300 years of life. Finally, the Abbot gives Batman directions to reach the drowned monastery in Lake Dess and Batman goes to investigate.
- The locals believe that the place is haunted by the soul of the last nun, who was burned at the stake and will not rest in peace until Manfred is gone.
- Inside the partially submerged building, Batman notices a strange light on a hallway and when he approaches, he is shocked to see the burning spirit of the nun. However, this was all a trick of his own mind, as he was simply staring into a mirror.
- Batman continues the investigation and finds a secret safe, which is locked with a rose combination. Batman recalls his nightmare and the words "unlock the rose". After opening the safe, Batman finds an old blueprint of a building resembling the Gotham Cathedral.
