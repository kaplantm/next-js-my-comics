- Bruce arrives at Wayne Manor. Woodley attacks, they fight but Woodley escapes.
- Batman tracks the Shaman him with the tracker he placed in the Shaman robes.
- Batman finds the Shaman in the midst of a sacrifice, and belittles and shames the fake Shaman in front of his men by using all the props and traps he prepared earlier, and so the cultists lose faith in the fake shaman, who turns out to be banker Carl Fisk. Batman ties up and leaves the Shaman for the police.
- Back in Wayne Manor, Batman looks for any sign of Woodley and after looking for a while, he finds the man agonizing in the middle of the snowy forest, having stabbed himself. Batman tries to save him but its too late. Before dying, the man surrenders the mask of the bat-shaman to Batman and Bruce decides to deliver it back to where it belongs.
- Bruce travels to Alaska and finds out that the shaman that cured him is already dead. The granddaughter teaches Bruce a very important lesson and he finally realizes that he must become the mask, for that is his destiny. Bruce returns to Gotham, places the bat-mask in the Batcave and goes out to patrol his city at night.
