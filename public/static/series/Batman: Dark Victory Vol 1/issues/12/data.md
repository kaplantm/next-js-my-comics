- Two days after Two-Face escaped from his trial, Janice Porter to the sewers to find him. Porter says shes loves him, but Two-Face shoots her and tells her he is a married man.
- Two days later, at the GCPD Headquarters, Commissioner Gordon and the last surviving member of the Special Crimes Units, Julia Lopez, listen to the last radio message by Officer Wilcox before she was hanged in the elevator. They realize that she recognized the killer.
- Batman arrives and says Porter has been missing. He also gives evidence Porter and Dent were close at Gotham University.
- At the Falcone Estate, Alberto Falcone wakes up in the middle of the night with the bloody body of Janice Porter on his bed. Scared, he sits up and finds that he is holding the gun used in his Holiday killings. Alberto jumps out of his bed and starts listening to "his father's voice" telling him that he is a shame to the Falcone family and that he should kill himself. Alberto knows that his father would never tell him to kill himself and he shoots at the mirror, revealing the Calendar Man on the other side.
- Two hours later, Batman and Gordon arrive a the Falcone Estate. Batman and Gordon go inside to find the whole place was wired with cameras and microphones, explaining why Alberto heard his "father's voice" and also Porter's insistence on sending Alberto to that house. There was no sign of Sofia. 
- Batman and Gordon find Porter's body in Alberto's room and they notice that she was killed with two shots from a .22 gun; just like Holiday's M.O. However, Batman noticed that Porter was dead for longer than a day and that her blood contained a chemical that preserved her body, similar to the one Mr. Freeze used on his wife. The evidence indicates that it is all a conspiracy against Alberto.
- Bruce examines the evidence of the hangman killings, but Dick Grayson keeps disturbing him. Dick just wants to help and he tells Bruce that maybe the first clue of the hangman killings isn't "None of you are safe", but "Nine of you are safe", based the picture of the nine remaining members of the Gotham Organized Crime that was on the screen of the Batcomputer.
- Batman goes to the Falcone Penthouse. He finds a secret door behind the bookshelf. He finds several hangman's knots and a hangman note with the message "you lose". Someone throws a noose and grabs Batman by the neck, pulling him out of the penthouse and leaves him hanging from the ledge of the building, when suddenly Catwoman appears to watch the scene.
