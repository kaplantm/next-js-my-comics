- Batman is hanging from a noose at the Falcone Penthouse, when Catwoman appears out of nowhere. Batman leaps back to the building and assumes that Catwoman is involved somehow in the hangman killings and he attacks her and forces her to confess where she has been for the last six months and why was she at the penthouse. Catwoman explains that the night Carmine Falcone was murdered, she scratched Sofia's face, just like she did her father. However, Sofia survived the fall from that night thanks to Catwoman's bola. As Catwoman explains the situation, Batman asks why she cares about Sofia and before she can answer, Batman leaves her talking alone.
- Batman returns to the Batcave and it is revealed that he was using a special neck brace that prevented him from being killed by the noose. Dick Grayson is willing to help, but Bruce isn't in the mood to deal with him. Dick tells Alfred that he just wants to help, but Bruce never asks and Alfred tells him that Bruce may never ask for it.
- At 2:00 a.m. of Columbus Day, Two-Face and his gang kill all the members of the Falcone Crime Family except for Sofia, Alberto and Mario.
- Meanwhile, at the Gotham Cemetery, James Gordon and Julia Lopez await at Janice Porter's grave to meet with Mario Falcone, who is looking for protection after all that's happened. 
- At that moment at the Falcone Mausoleum, Sofia Falcone is taking care of his wounded brother, Alberto, who was shot by Calendar Man. Alberto wants to go to a Hospital, but Sofia wouldn't allow it because they would be discovered if they go to any hospital. Sofia tells him to be like their father, who survived being shot five times in the chest. Alberto replies that he is not their father and Sofia is infuriated by the answer and kills Alberto by asphyxiating him.
- Later, Mario Falcone is taken to Gordon's office in the GCPD Headquarters, where he tells Gordon and Lopez about the deal he had with Janice Porter. Mario was giving Porter all the information about Sofia's movements in return of protection.
- At that moment, Batman appears in Gordon's office and reveals to them that Sofia Falcone is the Hangman Killer. As soon as Batman finished his sentence, a big explosion destroys the windows of the office and many explosions across the city are destroying the streets.
- The gas lines have been opened and set afire, causing the sewer system to collapse and forcing Two-Face and his gang leave their hideout in a hurry.
- Two-Face is escaping when suddenly a noose falls around his neck and he is hanged from one of the main pipes. Sofia reveals herself to the man she hated the most for killing her father. Batman arrives, saving Two-Face and fighting Sofia. During the fight, Two-Face shoots Sofia from behind, killing her.
- Two-Face reaches the gang and they find electrified fence in the sewers, breaking through to unexpectedly enter the Batcave. 
- Dick Grayson takes action, fighting the rogue. Batman arrives and they work together to fight Two-Face and the Joker. 
- Two-Face pulls out a gun and points it towards Batman. Two-Face feels victorious for having eliminated all the organized crime in Gotham, turning him into the most powerful force in the city, until Joker shoots him and makes him fall to a dark abyss in the cave. 
- Joker tells Batman that he wouldn't let Two-Face have it all, because in the end, all he wanted was to get rid of the organized crime, just like the "old" Harvey Dent. Joker starts telling Batman that only they understand Gotham City but before he is finished, Dick knocks him down by breaking a staff in his face.
- At the Falcone Estate, Mario has lost what he had left of sanity and he burned the whole place down after learning that Sofia Falcone murdered their own brother Alberto. As the last member of the Falcone Crime Empire, the man is left in a broken state.
- Selina Kyle visits the reconstructed gravesite of Carmine Falcone and she reveals that she always robbed from him because she always had the right to claim some of his money to change her life into one that she deserved. She explains that she left for Italy in order to prove once and for all that she is Carmine's daughter. She failed, but deep inside, she is convinced that Falcone is her father.
- Meanwhile, somewhere in Gotham's sewers, Two-Face keeps the corpse of the man he hated the most, Carmine Falcone, inside a block of ice.
- In the Batcave, Dick tells that he chose his costume in honor of his dead parents and that his secret name from now own will be Robin. Under the dim light of a candle, the two orphans swear to protect Gotham together. Batman and Robin.
