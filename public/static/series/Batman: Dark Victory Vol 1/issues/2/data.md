- At the Batcave, Batman is poring over the forensic data from O'Hara's murder. He figured out it wasn't a simply hanging, the killer likely used a trap. He thinks Two-Face may be involved.
- Mario Falcone summons Gordon and Porter to his father's gravesite, were his body has gone missing. He is willing to work with the police to prove that he is sincere about cleaning up his family's reputation.
- Their meeting is interrupted by Sofia, who tells Mario that since Gordon cannot protect his own men, he cannot be entrusted with the safety of her family. Instead, she has armed private investigators.
- At the Falcone estate, Alberto hears a disembodied voice, telling him he cannot stop now, or they will forget about him.
