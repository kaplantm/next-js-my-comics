- Two-Face is prisoner at the Gotham City Jailhouse. Two-Face asks Porter to bring all the evidence of the hangman case to his trial.
- Meanwhile, Batman is at the Maroni's restaurant, getting Pino and Umberto to tell him Tony Zucco's location.
- Dick has been training to help Batman take down Zucco. Batman says it's time.
- In the Falcone Estate, Alberto Falcone is wearing his Holiday outfit, while hearing "his dead father's voice", telling him to take control of the Falcone crime family.
- Holiday opens the door of the room where Sofia Falcone is, sitting in her wheelchair and looking herself at the mirror, without her wig. Silently, she mutters the word "poppa" and touches the scars on her face, similar to the ones her father had. Alberto has no heart to kill his sister and quietly walks away.
- Later, at The Ox Club, Tony Zucco is having dinner, when Batman interrupts him and questions him about the murder of the Graysons. Zucco runs but it stopped by Dick Grayson. Suddenly, Zucco starts having a stroke and Batman stops Dick from further hurting Zucco. Zucco dies in Batman's arms.
- At that same moment, Janice Porter meets with Mario Falcone to discuss their deal. He doesn't want to be involved in police investigations, but Janice tells him that she is in control. She tells him to go away before "someone drops a noose around his neck".
- The next day, during the trial of Two-Face, the floor of the courthouse explodes and Mister Freeze, Solomon Grundy and Poison Ivy appear from underneath it. Batman tries to fight them off but Two Face takes some trial evidence and escapes.
- That night, in the Courthouse, Officer Lauren Wilcox caught in a noose and killed with a hangman game left behind. It seems she recognized her assailant.
