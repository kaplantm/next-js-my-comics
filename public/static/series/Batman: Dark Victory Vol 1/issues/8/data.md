- Mother's Day. Joker attacks the Maroni Crime Family at their restaurant. Joker escapes as GCPD and Batman arrive. Batman deduces that Joker used the sewers to escape.
- Later, in the Falcone Penthouse, Mario Falcone is hosting a meeting to discuss business with Gotham's bankers. Bruce Wayne is among them. Joker appears and starts shooting at them. Bruce and Mario find cover behind a desk. Bruce wonders why Joker attacked the Maronis and Falcones the same day.
- James Gordon and Janice Porter find Officer Henry Gustavson, Gordon's bodyguard, hanged on top of his car with a hangman note attached to his dead body.
- That night at the Falcone Estate near Wayne Manor, the Joker has broken into the house and killed the servant Angelo Mirti and then pushes Sofia Falcone, wheelchair bound, down the stairs. Joker tells Sofia that he thinks she can actually move, and that if she doesn't get up he will shoot her. At that moment, Joker is shot in the shoulder by Alberto Falcone; a.k.a. Holiday.
- Batman breaks in and takes down Falcone but Sofia tells him that the Joker is the true menace. Batman follows the clown outside the house and knocks him out. 
- Bruce regrets not being able to visit his mother's grave on mother's day.
- At that moment in Haly's Circus, Tony Zucco talks to Mr. Haly and tries to convince him to let him use the circus as a way to transport "stuff" across the state lines. Haly wasn't completely sure but Zucco forces him by threatening the circus' main attraction: The Flying Graysons. The whole scene was being watched by the child acrobat, Dick Grayson.
- Bruce returns to Wayne Manor, where Alfred gives him his daily mail. There is a couple of tickets and Alfred reminds him that he was going to take Selina Kyle to the circus after he made a donation. Bruce doesn't feel like going to the circus, but Alfred reminds him that the donation was done to the Martha Wayne foundation and he feels that Bruce must attend to The Haly Circus.
