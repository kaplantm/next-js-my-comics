- On father's day, Dick Grayson is taken to Wayne Manor as Bruce has become Dick's guardian. However, Dick is still troubled for his parents' deaths and he gives Alfred a hard time.
- Meanwhile, Tony Zucco and Eddie Skeevers realize how fortunate they are after having successfully elminated the circus' main attraction. Zucco tells Eddie that he is planning to get total control of the circus for his illegal activites, but they are still a bit worried about the Grayson kid, who might say something that would affect them.
- At the GCPD Headquarters, Alberto, Sofia and Mario Falcone are being held prisoners after the Joker's attempt to murder the three of them. Commissioner Gordon and Batman believe that one of them is involved in the Joker's crimes and they are waiting for proof. 
- D.A. Janice Porter arrives and tells them that a judge has ordered the Falcones' release.
- Meanwhile at Wayne Manor, Dick Alfred why did Bruce took him in and Alfred tells him about Bruce's parents. Dick realizes that they are both orphans and that he is all alone now. Alfred tells Dick that he is not alone and that he will never be again.
- At the GCPD, Gordon gathers the special crimes units on the rooftop and tells them that he doesn't want them involved in the hangman case anymore because of what happened to Gustavson. However, they tell Gordon that they want to keep working in the case. Gordon reluctantly agrees but then he realizes that officer O'Connor wasn't present. 
- As they were speaking, O'Connor has been killed by the hangman killer in his own shower.
- At Wayne Manor, Batman finds Dick Grayson on the ledge of the upper rooftop. Dick tells him that he knows what happened to his parents wasn't an accident and Batman tells him that he believes him, as he found traces of acid in the trapeze ropes. Eager to help Batman, Dick tells him about the "fat man" who threatened Mr. Haly some time ago. Batman promises Dick that when the time is right, he will be of some help but for now, he should go inside the house.
- Later that night, Bruce visits his parents graves and tells them about Dick. He hopes that he can make a difference in the life of the boy, trying to be a father figure, just like his own father was to him.
