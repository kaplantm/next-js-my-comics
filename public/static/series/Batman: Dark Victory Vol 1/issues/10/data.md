- The fourth of July in Gotham City. Dick Grayson, feels abandoned when Bruce often leaves him alone because he has "other plans".
- Later, Commissioner Gordon has decided to act on the evidence incriminating Harvey Dent in the hangman killings. Gordon takes some of the special crimes units with him to the sewers to find Dent. Batman follows.
- Two-Face realizes that the police has found him and that he needs to escape somehow. Dent asks Mister Freeze to create an ice wall to delay the police from reaching them and then he tells The Mad Hatter to spread the word and get everybody out of the sewers.
- After a fight with Dent and some of the other Rogues, Gordon tells Harvey to drop the gun and surrender his hostage, and after some tense moments, Dent does as Gordon told him, allowing Jim to place him under arrest. Batman contemplates the scene, hardly believing how things used to be in the past.
- Later that night, in Haly's Circus, a man that works for Tony Zucco is threatening Mr. Haly by reminding him what happened to the Graysons. Suddenly, a rock smashed the window of the office and the man goes outside and finds little Dick Grayson, who asks him to tell whatever he knows about the death of the Graysons, but a second man attacks Dick from behind. At that moment, Batman arrives and takes the man out and tells them to stay off the circus, while Dick passes out.
- Dick recovers and wakes in the Batcave, where he questions Batman and his motives for caring so much for him, believing that even Bruce Wayne doesn't care for him. Batman takes off his cowl and reveals his true identity to Dick, and he tells him that they have much to discuss.
