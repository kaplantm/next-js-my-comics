- In the early days of No Man's Land, Clayface broke into Robinson Park. He offered Ivy a deal - she would produce fruit with help of the refugee kids in the park and he would handle distribution. Ivy tried to “seal the deal” with a kiss to kill, but her plan backfired.
- Present time, Oracle tells Batman about kids seen in Robinson Park. Batman finds out from Penguin that Clayface is running fruit distribution for Ivy. 
- Batman and Robin go to Robinson Park and they enter a secret lair Bruce built while he was gone. Inside they find Ivy and her kids, encased in clay and begging for help.
- GCPD are having internal struggles and the department splits, with some people staying under the command of James Gordon and some following Pettit.
