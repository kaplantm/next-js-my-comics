- Bats worries this disaster is an enemy that he can't fight. Bats helps in rescue efforts.
- He can't do all of this alone, so find the Penguin. Instead of looting, the Penguin is going to use his considerable resources to help in the relief efforts, because if he doesn't, Bats will make his life hell. Also Gotham is under martial law, looters would probably be shot anyway.
- Tim is in Bludhaven, he steals a motorcycle to get to Gotham (leaves a note heâ€™ll pay them back).
- Seismologist Jolene Relazzo, who predicted the quake, is trapped in her apartment. Two henchmen kidnap her. Their boss believes he can profit off the disaster, and she is part of their plan.
- There is a news broadcast once the televisions are back online...A new villain named Quakemaster is taking credit for the quake and threatening another unless given a million dollars.
