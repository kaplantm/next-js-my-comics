- Jeremiah Arkham is having troubles at Arkham Asylum. Most of the orderlies haven't shown up for duty and the supplies are running out fast. He knows Gotham is destined to fall, but tries to run the Asylum as best he can.
- When night arrives, a dark figure walks through the corridors. The inmates go crazy, screaming, because it resembles Batman.
- Meanwhile, Bruce Wayne is struggling to keep his city alive but he is feeling physically tired and Alfred suggests to him that maybe this time, Bruce can an actually help more than Batman by going to the congressional hearings and trying to convince the government to help Gotham.
- The next day, Joker switches Croc’s meds to amphetamines and breaks into Jeremiah’s office. Joker tells him that he has planned some sort of gladiatorial combat in the Asylum.
