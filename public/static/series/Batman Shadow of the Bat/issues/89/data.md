- Elsewhere, a couple of hoodlums are beating The King but before they can finish him, they are attacked by Killer Croc, who wants The King.
- On his search, Batman realizes that the man's work is all around Gotham. Batman deduces that The King must obtain the supplies from somewhere, so he heads to the man with resources; Penguin. 
- Batman asks Penguin about The King. Penguin says he has been trading goods with the man, but Batman makes him realize that The King has been stealing from him and Penguin is infuriated. 
- Batman goes looking for clues on The King's whereabouts. He finds a trail of dead and unconscious crooks, he finds a scale at the Crime scene and knows to is behind it.
- Killer Croc is at Babylon Towers's Mall beating The King and telling him to acknowledge Croc as the real king of Gotham. 
- Batman uses a concussion grenade to stun Croc's henchmen and knocks them all down. Batman and Croc fight. Batman sends Croc flying down a four-floor drop. Batman knows that Croc can survive it.
- Batman checks on The King and learns that the man's identity is Stanley Demchaszky, a former criminal and Blackgate inmate. Stanley tells Batman that he was released from prison the day before the earthquake and that he stayed in Gotham to help the people to redeem himself. Batman is unsure of what to do next.
- Batman takes Stanley back to the refugee center and the people finally meet The King of Gotham.
