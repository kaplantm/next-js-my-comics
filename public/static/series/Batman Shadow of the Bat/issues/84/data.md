- Scarecrow collects rats and sets them upon the ARCâ€™s food stores to create chaos and fear.
- Father Chris, unknown to Father Papaleo, makes a deal with Penguin for food for the ARC - in exchange, he lets Penguin store guns in their bunker.
- Back at the center, former Black Masker Mikey seems to be a good dude.
- Elsewhere, at the building where Penguin was previously storing his arsenal, the splinter group of the False Facers, try to steal the supplies (not know they were moved). Batman stops them, but they also notice the building was empty and rigged to catch fire so people would think the arsenal was gone.
- Meanwhile, under the refugee center, Father Chris is organizing the arsenal, while Scarecrow asks him how he felt about making a deal with the devil.
- Scarecrow then talks to Mikey, misleading Mikey into believing that Father Chris want him to talk to his old gang and ask for them help. Mikey brings a box of weapons to the False Facers, asking for their protection.
- Leo, leader of the group, takes one of the guns and shoots Mikey. Huntress finds him, left for dead in the street, with a note calling him a traitor, as Scarecrow watches from the shadows.
