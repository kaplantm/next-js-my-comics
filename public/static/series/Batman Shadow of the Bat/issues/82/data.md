- Jeremiah Arkham is still in his office but is suspicious as to why his office door is unlocked. He starts to write in his diary, then checks on the inmates. All the inmates are down in the corridors and have surrounded “Batman”, who in turn threatens them and tells them to go back to their cells immediately.
- The inmates laugh and attack, until Jeremiah arrives and they stop - turns out it isn’t Batman, its David Thurman; Jeremiah's right hand doctor. Thurman said he sorry for having failed Arkham and then dies.
- Jeremiah runs away and locks himself in his office again.
- Days pass, the inmates party, and supplies run low. After Joker kills one of the inmates, some of them decide to let loose some of the most dangerous criminals and more victims are claimed by Poison Ivy, Victor Zsasz, Cornelius Stirk and Solly Bean.
- When the inmates are close to breaking out, Jeremiah offers them a deal: he will open the doors and let them out with the condition that they never go to Gotham; but if the break into his office, he will destroy the door controls and they will all be trapped inside forever. The inmates agree and the doors open.
- The inmates head straight for Gotham (except Riddler). Jeremiah knew that they wouldn't listen, but he tried to hold them as long as possible so Gotham had already been abandoned.
- He is still afraid to leave his office; he can still smell a cigar and hears the Joker’s laugh.
