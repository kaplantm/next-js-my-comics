- Bock wins the cage fight. Penguin gives Bock the instructions for that night for his people to escape.
- Bock and Vanessa DeVries move the children in their care to the bus that will take them to the way out of Gotham. Robin arrives and helps protect the bus from attacking gangs (many people angry at Bock, lost a lot of money betting on the fight). They reach the underground train station to escape Gotham.
- Penguin, who is empathetic toward Bockâ€™s kids after losing one of his birds to the Joker, send people to help protect the train out.
- As a result of the skirmish, the train crashes into the outside wall of Gotham. The U.S. Marshals notice the train coming from out of it and go to check the situation. The kids are taken to a hospital - Vanessa and her father go with them. Block returns to Gotham. The Marshalls seal the tunnel.
