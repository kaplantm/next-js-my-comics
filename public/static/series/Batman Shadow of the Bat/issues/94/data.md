- December 31: James Gordon, Barbara Gordon, Richard Grayson, Lex Luthor and the Gotham City Police Department are at the funeral ceremony for Sarah Essen. Batman shows up in front of them and Jim asks him if it was all worth it. Batman doesn't answer.
- Lex Luthor starts to execute his master plan and begins buying real estate in Gotham City. Later, at Oracle's Watchtower, Batman and Oracle find out Lex is buying real estate from land owners that died during the earthquake, using a fake account and name. Batman arranges a meeting with Lucius Fox to prevent Luthor from achieving his goal.
- In the GCPD Headquarters, the members of the force are remembering their times and experiences with Sarah Essen and they celebrate her life. Renee Montoya, however, notices that the Jim Gordon isn't present and she looks for him and finds the man, alone and devastated in the backyard of the building.
- At Wayne Enterprises, Lucius Fox meets with Bruce Wayne and explains to him about Luthor's irregular activities. Lex is planning to own Gotham by buying the majority of the real estate in the city. Bruce fakes surprise and Lucius tells him that he is going to talk to Luthor personally. Knowing Lucius will be killed if he confronts Luthor directly, Batman follows him to the Gala for reopening Gotham.
- Lucius confronts Lex. As soon as Lucius steps outside, Lex tells Mercy kill him. Batman arrives and defeats Mercy. Batman stares at Luthor and warns him again not to mess with Gotham as it isn't for sale.
- At midnight, Nightwing goes to Park Row's medical center and visits the recovering Helena Bertinelli. When the clock strikes midnight, they kiss.
- James Gordon is at the Gotham Cemetery, in front of Sara's tombstone with a couple of champagne flutes. Jim shares the coming of the new year with his bride, in a symbolic way. At the same time, Batman leaves a couple of roses at the Waynes' tombstone and looks to the sky with renewed hope.
