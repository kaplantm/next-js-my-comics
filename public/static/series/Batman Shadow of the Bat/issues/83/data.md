- Oracle hears about the Batman tag, so says it doesn’t sound like him, and he hasn’t tried to contact her.
- Commissioner Gordon declares the Blue Boys will next liberate Old Gotham and their old police headquarters. They stir up a gang war between the Loboys and Street demons to thin their ranks. To do so, they go into Street Demonz territory to spray a false Loboys tag, but things get out of hand and they end up killing two gang members.
- This only serves as fodder for the gang war though, and the gangs do begin killing each other off.
- Elsewhere, Batgirl saves two kids from being robbed. She claims to be the Batman, and that the area is under her protection.

### Interludes:

- Punk tries to rob someone at gunpoint for batteries, but they realize his gun is unloaded because no one would waste bullets (rare) for batteries.
- Punk tries to rob kid, but someone shows up and protects him.
- Punk tries to rob stranger, but shit its the Joker and he gets stabbed. Joker tags a wall and declares the area "Jokerville."
