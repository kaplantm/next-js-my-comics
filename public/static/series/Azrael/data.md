Follows Azrael, the alter ego of Jean-Paul Valley. After the debut of Azrael in the Batman: Sword of Azrael miniseries and the character's role in Knightfall, Azrael was given his own series. Starting with issue #47, the title was changed to Azrael: Agent of the Bat to emphasize his role as a member of the Batman Family.
