- Batgirl and Catwoman explain the situation to Batman. Batman takes Batgirl with him to handle the Russians, and since the Batmobile can only seat two, Catwoman is left behind.
- Batman and Batgirl spy on Vassily Davidovitch as he makes a deal with Riddler to decode Gordon's notebook in exchange for something in a suitcase. Vassily offers Elena to the Riddler, at which point Catwoman bursts through the window to save her friend.
- Batman tells Batgirl to stay back as Catwoman fights Anatoly, but Batgirl dives in to save her when Anatoly has her at his mercy. Catwoman leaves with Elena, and Batman joins Batgirl in her fight against the Davidovitch brothers. He knocks out Anatoly in one punch while Vassily gets away, and he pursues Vassily (and the suitcase) while Batgirl goes after the Riddler and the notebook.
- Batgirl tracks the Riddler to Arkham Asylum, where he traps her and unleashes the inmates.
