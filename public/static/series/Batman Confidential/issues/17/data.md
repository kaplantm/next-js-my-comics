- Barbara Gordon is working at the Gotham City Public Library when she notices her father's notebook is gone. She dons her Batgirl costume and chases after the culprit: Catwoman.
- Batgirl pursues Catwoman across Gotham until Catwoman turns around and fights her. Batgirl uses a smoke bomb to gain the upper hand, but it doesn't last long. Catwoman regains control of the situation and escapes again. She decides to go somewhere Batgirl won't follow.
- Catwoman leads Batgirl to The Gotham City Hedonist Society where no one can enter unless they're naked. Determined, Batgirl strips off her entire costume except the mask.
