- Batgirl saves Catwoman from falling, and they land in a dumpster. Batgirl uses a mirror to locate the shooter and heads up to the rooftop to confront him. He manages to get the jump on her, though, and Catwoman has to rescue her.
- The shooter flees with Gordon's notebook, but Batgirl placed a tracer on it and they follow him to a warehouse.
- Catwoman tells Batgirl she needs the notebook to rescue her friend Elena, who is an illegal immigrant being used as a slave by Vassily Davidovitch. Catwoman wanted to use James Gordon's notes to start a gang war and free her.
- Catwoman walks into the warehouse and pretends to make a deal with Vassily. When he orders Elena brought out, she signals Batgirl to cut the lights. In the dark, she takes out his men, while outside Anatoly attacks Batgirl.
- The fight goes badly for Batgirl and Catwoman. Vassily leaves with Elena and gives the order to blow up the warehouse. They barely escape in time. They are injured and laying on the ground when Batman shows up.
