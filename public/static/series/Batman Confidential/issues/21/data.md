- Batgirl is locked inside Arkham Asylum, and the Riddler has unleashed the inmates. Batgirl fights them or outsmarts them all while the Riddler monologues on the sound system.
- The Riddler has given her several clues that help her figure out the access code to the security control room; however, by the time she gets inside, Catwoman has already taken care of the Riddler. Catwoman hands Batgirl Gordon's notebook.
- They meet up with Batman, who has stopped the Russians. Batgirl leaves to meet her father, but she still hears when Batman asks what Catwoman thinks of Batgirl and she admits that "she's got the chops."
- Pleased, Batgirl returns home to sleep, only to be woken up by her alarm as soon as she gets in bed.
