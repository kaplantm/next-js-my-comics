- Huntress has confronted Santo Cassamento regarding an old photo showing him with Helena's mother. Cassemento claims that he is Helena's father. According to him, Maria was treated badly by her husband and had an affair with him. When the Sicilian mafia mega boss Stefano Mandragora ordered to wipe out the Bertinellis, Santo passed on the order but with the condition to "spare the sister". But he meant to spare Tomaso's sister Maria and not the little sister, Helena. This fueled Santo's hate for Helena - feeling like she was living the stolen life of his lover, Maria. 
- Cassamento is trying to frame Huntress so he can use her abilities for his criminal business.
- Later, Huntress stands on a roof thinking about these revelations. She is approached by Nightwing who confirms what Cassamento told Helena (proven by a D.N.A. test run by Batman). 
- Huntress comes up with a plan. She accepts the invitation to the wedding of her female cousin Monica and she will be accompanied by Vic Sage. Helena takes advantage of a Sicilian tradition were the and asks a favor from her uncle Tomaso Panessa, Maria's brother.
- Huntress scares off Mario Cassamento, forcing Santo to take over his deals. But in a warehouse were the deal was mean to go down, Tomaso awaiting Santo. He kills him in retribution for the death of his sister, at Helena's request. Huntress calls the police so that Tomaso gets arrested. 
- The Question still is more than unhappy that Huntress got Santo killed although she did not do it herself directly.
