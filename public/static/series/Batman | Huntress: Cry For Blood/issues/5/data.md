- After three months, Huntress has returned to Gotham City with by The Question. 
- Batman is awaiting Helena in her apartment. He offers to give her enough room to clear her name as long as she does not clash with the GCPD.
- Robin shows up, interrupting a romantic moment between Helena and Vic. Robin tells her that he  and Oracle reviewed Helena's history and hands over all the files to her.
- Meanwhile, Helena tells Vic more about how she became Huntress. She went to the University of Palermo and studied anything that was Mafia-related until eventually returning to Gotham City. 
- Vic asks about the killer of her parents. She says those involved are already dead, but Helena still doesn't know why she was spared. 
- Vic goes outside to figure out who is watching the apartment. It is a PI, working for Santo Cassamento. This suddenly makes sense because Helena just looked at a picture which was taken by the FBI (and in the files Robin dropped off) and showing her mother together with Cassamento. 
- Helena puts on her costume and asks Cassamento straight on what his relationship with her mom was. Cassemento points out the obvious...he is Helena's father!
