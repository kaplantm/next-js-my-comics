- Bruce Wayne and Alfred Pennyworth are heading to the hospital where a member of the Order of St. Dumas is hospitalized, when suddenly they see Jean-Paul Valley apparently falling to his death from a hospital window.
- Bruce enters the hospital through the window just in time to stop Biis from killing Nomoz. Biis then tries to escape but is followed by Bruce. They fight, but Biis manages to drug Bruce and take him away.
- Meanwhile, Alfred and Nomoz decide to work together to stop Biis and rescue Bruce. They take Jean-Paul to a hideout of the Order of St. Dumas so he can recover. Then, they decide to go to the houses of the possible next victims.
- Biis is faster, and he murders another member of the Order before Alfred, Nomoz, and Jean-Paul can do anything.
- Alfred, Nomoz, and Azrael go to the mansion of order member Mr. Harcourt to prevent his murder. However, Biis is already inside and posing as Batman with the costume he took from Bruce.
