- The  security team at Harcourt's mansion attempt to subdue Azrael. They fail, but Azrael soon finds he is too late Harcourt has already been murdered by Carleton LeHah, disguised as Batman.
- LeHah tries to escape in a car. Azrael tries to stop him, but Lehah escapes.
- Alfred, Azrael and Nomoz travel to LeHah's possible location: an oil refinery in Texas.
- Meanwhile, LeHah is holding Bruce Wayne captive in the refinery. To appease his demon lord Biis, LeHah tortures Bruce with hot steel heated by a blowtorch. But Bruce talks to him, confusing the man and buying some time.
- Alfred, Nomoz, and Azrael try to find a way in. Suddenly, a bolt of lightning strikes a nearby electrical tower, causing a power failure that grants access into the building. 
- Just before LeHah fires a bullet at Bruce, Azrael throws a flaming knife at him, causing LeHah to fire at some pipes at the roof. The pipes started to leak oil, which soon ignites.
- Azrael saves Bruce by using the fireproof cape of Batman's costume and carrying him out of the explosion. LeHah is left inside and apparently burns to death.
- Nomoz reproaches Azrael for saving Bruce, saying that he has disgraced the name of the Avenging Angel. Jean-Paul answers that he is no angel, implying that he has gained control over the system.
