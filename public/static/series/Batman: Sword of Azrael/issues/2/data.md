- Bruce and Alred's helicopter crashes, they survive, but the site is completely destroyed.
- Jean-Paul and Nomoz have survived the explosion because they headed to an underground shelter.
- An avalanche happens as a result of the explosion, covering the underground shelter and damaging the chopper used by LeHah to escape. After their copper had crashed down, Lehah felt the presence of Biis, a demon lord considered an archenemy of Azrael. Under his influence, LeHah murders his accomplice.
- Suddenly, the ground beneath Bruce and Alfred under them begins to crumble. From underneath comes a hovercraft with Nomoz and Jean-Paul inside.
- Bruce, now dressed as Batman, is attacked by Azrael and left behind in the snow. Instead of following the hovercraft, Batman and Alfred decide to check the hideout the vehicle came from. They find information about the Order of St. Dumas.
- Nomoz explains to Jean-Paul that Lehah was the treasurer of the Order of St. Dumas, but recently betrayed them by draining a bank account. Azrael was sent to deal with him. Lehah is especially dangerous because, as treasurer, he has informations about all the members.
- LeHah, now acting as Biis, starts a manhunt of the people who belong to the Order of St. Dumas. Nomoz, being aware of that fact, decides to go with Jean-Paul to visit an old member of the Order who is currently hospitalized. Just as they arrive in the hospital room, they realize Biis is already there. Jean-Paul is shot many times and pushed through a window, falling down to certain death.
