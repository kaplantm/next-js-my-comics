- Batman is giving Dick Grayson his a final exam before he's allowed to go out on patrol as a crime-fighter.
- The challenge: he will be given a six-hour headstart at dusk, and then Batman will hunt him down and try to find him within city limits. If he can make it until sunrise without being caught, he passes. 
- Dick goes out as Robin for the first time, and quickly finds himself embroiled in a criminal plot that he must stop while evading his mentor and many gangsters all across the city.
- Batman catches up to him and is content to watch him from the shadows, and observe the way he handles taking down a syndicate of Gotham Organized Crime, surpassing expectations. 
- Robin takes down a crimelord by recovering crucial evidence, and Batman tells him that he has passed, then introduces him to Captain Gordon.
