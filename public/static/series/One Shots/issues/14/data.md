- Batman and Gordon investigate of a serial killer who murders child abusers. 
- It is revealed that James Gordon had an abusive father and nearly treats his son the same way but is working to break the cycle. His son and wife are not living with him full time due this and other marital issues (infidelity on his part).
- Signs point toward Batman being the serial killer as some of the surviving kids say it was the Batman and are scared of him.
- Also, there is some commentary on varying level of police action based on wealth inequality.
- The culprit was guy with a military background that saw many children suffer in his military career. He came back and started hearing the cries of childhood abuse victims. He would go out and kill their parents.
- Eventually, he kills himself feeling there was too many cries of suffering for him to deal with.
- Batman is left thinking about how he can’t possibly hear all the cries of those children in need. There are some victims Batman just can’t get to.
