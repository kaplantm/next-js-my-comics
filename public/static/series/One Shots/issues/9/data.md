- 19th century
- Bruce Wayne’s parents shot by highwayman.
- Bruce has been traveling overseas, and is currently leaving Vienna after studying psychology with Dr. Sigmund Freud.
- Bruce departs from London on a passenger ship back to Gotham and unexpectedly meets his old family friend, Jacob Packer, a personal friend of Thomas Wayne.
- Bruce reunited with Alfred and heads back to the manor, where its revealed that he has the Batsuit.
- During the night, Bruce Wayne fights criminals as Batman.
- A series of women found murdered throughout the city, a parallel to the women killed in London previously by Jack the Ripper. Some wonder is Batman is to blame.
- Police Commissioner Tolliver claims that he has deduced the killer's identity: Bruce Wayne. The police search the Manor and fine bloody gloves and a knife (planted by the real killer).
- Bruce is brought, with Jacob Packer acting as his counsel. During the trial, Tolliver points out that Bruce was present in London during the time of the Ripper murders, the times that Bruce was absent late at night, and his medical training. Bruce is found guilty by the jury and is sentenced to be hanged.
- Bruce is imprisoned at Arkham Asylum to await his execution. Inspector Gordon comes to visit Bruce and secretly passes on the police's findings related to the Ripper case at Bruce's request in order to clear his name by finding the actual murderer. Bruce eventually discovers a photograph showing Thomas Wayne and his colleagues as field surgeons during the American Civil War with a regimental flag bearing a symbol similar to the one on the murderer's weapon. He notes that Packer is the only remaining alive from the regiment.
- Bruce then contacts Alfred and escapes, donning the Batsuit and to stop the Ripper, who had been patiently delaying his murder spree until Bruce’s execution.
- Jacob explains his motive: he was in love with Martha Wayne, and she had no interest in him. This caused Jacob to see every woman as a "whore" like Martha, laughing at him and subsequently driving him to murder them. He also revealed that he hired a gunman to kill Bruce’s parents, but was angered by the fact that Bruce survived.
- After revealing this, Bruce unmasks and punches Jacob upon his parents' grave.
- GCPD arrives, preventing Bruce’s anger from escalating to murder. Batman (after concealing his face) informs Gordon that Jacob is the Ripper. Jacob admits his guilt.
- As Gordon goes to arrest both Jacob and Batman, Jacob quickly slashes Batman and is gunned down by Gordon.
- Batman thanks Gordon and reminds him to release Bruce Wayne. Gordon then asks about Jacob’s motive, and Batman only replies "who truly understands a madman?" After Batman disappears into the night, Gordon decides not to arrest the vigilante and believes that the police and Gotham need him as their "guardian angel."
