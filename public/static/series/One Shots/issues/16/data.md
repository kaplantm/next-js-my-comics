- In the 1920s, Amadeus Arkham converts his family’s manor into Arkham Asylum after his mother’s madness and eventual suicide. 
- In the present, patients have taken over the asylum, with Joker and Black Mask leading. Hostages are: Pearl (kitchen), Administrator, Dr. Cavendish; and therapist Dr. Ruth Adams. 
- Batman is forced to navigate through the the building, fighting enemies along the way. Makes his way to a secret tower room where he finds Dr. Cavendish (turns out he organized the riot) in a bridal down holding a straight razor to Dr. Adam’s throat. 
- When questioned by Batman, Cavendish prompts Batman to read Amadeus Arkham's secret diary: Elizabeth Arkham had delusions of a Bat tormenting her. Eventually Amadeus decided to free her from her delusions by killing her, but later blocked out the memory. Years later, his wife and daughter were murdered by one of his former patients, a serial killer named Martin "Mad Dog" Hawkins. This brings back the memory of killing his mom, and he commits the rest of his life to destroying evil spirit of "The Bat", eventually going insane and being sent to Arkham himself. 
- Cavendish discovered these journals and believes he is destined to continue Arkham's work. On April 1, the date Arkham's family was murdered, he lured Batman to the asylum. Believing Batman to be "The Bat" itself, Cavendish accuses him of feeding the evil of the house by bringing it more insane souls.
Cavendish fights with Batman, dropping the razor, and Adams picks it up and kills him. 
- Trying to escape the Asylum, Batman and the inmates let Two-Face decide his fate. Two-Face flips the coin (says scratched side up means they kill Batman) and declares Batman free. Batman leaves the Asylum and the inmates peacefully return to their cells, except for Two-Face, and it is revealed that the coin actually landed scratched side up
