- Bruce has been batman a year. Crime is more extreme, now with more costumed criminals.
- GCPD and Batman find disfigured corpses with white skin, green hair, and large smiles.
- A newscaster is hit uncontrollable laughter, then dies with a a grin. The newscast is hijacked by Joker, who says he’ll kill millionaire Henry Claridge at midnight.
- The police and Batman guard Claridge, no sign of Joker. At midnight he abruptly collapses from Joker’s delayed-action poison. Meanwhile, the Joker frees and arms a bunch of psych patients. Batman fights them, then starts working on an antidote to the Joker's poison.
- Joker says he’ll murder Jay Wilde at midnight. Joker show up and crashes helicopter. Fights batman, but gets away, and Wilde is found dead, grazed by a poison-coated bullet.
- Batman investigates Ace Chemical Processing, which Claridge and Wilder founded. Learns the plant's wastewater makes skin white and hair green. Suspects the Joker is the Red Hood, who dove into tanks to escape Batman pursuit months ago.
- Joker announces he’ll murder Judge Thomas Lake and Bruce Wayne. Police guard the manor but Bruce fakes the Joker’s attack by injecting himself with Joker poison so Alfred can "take him to the hospital." While under the effects of the Joker poison, he understands the Joker’s motive: a paranoid egotism, hating all of Gotham for "allowing" the pollution that disfigured him. Bruce gives himself the antidote then gets Batty.
- Batman deduces that the Joker's true goal is to poison Gotham's drinking water. Reservoir water has already been poisoned, but not yet unreleased. Batman set explosive charges on controls, leaving it impossible to release the water. Then Batman beats up the Joker.
- Wayne Enterprises pays for the reservoir repairs and the Joker is sent to Arkham Asylum.
- Also they invent the bat symbol (again).
