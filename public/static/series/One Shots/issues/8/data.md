#### The Message
- A man called Jason Braun begins hearing voices after a bat bit him. He was planning to leave No Man’s Land before the bridges are blown, but the voices tell him he must first deliver a message.
- The voice guides Jason to Oracle and asks her for the city's guardian angel. She gives him a location. Before leaving, Jason tells Oracle that the city has a message for her; that she has served the city better as Oracle than ever before.
- Penguin’s men try to steal from him but he runs into Robinson park, and Poison Ivy takes them down. Jason leaves Robinson park
- Jason is feeling bad and his vision is blurring. He arrives at the courthouse as Oracle told him. Two-Face asks him what he was doing. Jason tells him that he is looking for the cemetery near the courthouse. Two-Face takes the man to the cemetery and Jason finally finds the crouching angel statue in the cemetery. He goes to it, but his condition worsens. 
- Two-Face tosses his coin and is about to kill Jason when Huntress appears and stops him. Jason reaches the angel, but he is dying. Huntress approaches Jason to see if he is alright, but Jason sees Batman instead of Huntress. The voice in Jason's head then tells him that the city needs him and that he must not leave yet. Jason speaks these words to Huntress who got the message.
