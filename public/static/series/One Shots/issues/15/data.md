- Bats goes to Arkham to mope to the Joker about them being bad for each other. Turns out Joker escaped.
- Joker takes over an abandoned amusement park. He reminiscences about who he used to be: a bad comedian with a day job at chemical company. To support his pregnant wife, he agrees to help criminals rob the plant. 
- His wife is killed in an accident and he tries to get out the robbery but can’t. The criminals force him to dress as the Red Hood to divert attention on to him (so cops think he's the ringleader). 
- Batman shows up, not-yet-joker jumps into chemicals to escape, it turns his skin white, hair green, makes him insane etc. 
- Joker shows up a Commissioner Gordon’s house, shooters Barbara (Batgirl) when she opens the door paralyzing her from the waist down. Undresses her and takes pictures. 
- Joker kidnaps Gordon, and forces him on a crazy ride filled with images of Barbara. His motivation is that just one bad day is all it takes to drive a man to insanity, and he intends to do this to Gordon.
- Batman arrives and saves Gordon, who is still sane. Joker tries to persuade Bats that the world is inherently insane and not worth fighting for. Batman captures him and tries to convince him to give up crime. Joker says “It's too late for that... far too late". He tells a joke and for once makes Bats laugh.
