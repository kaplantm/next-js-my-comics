- Batgirl tracks Joker and his goons to save hostages. In self defense, she kills a goon with a fire poker which shakes her a bit.
- Joker explains that he killed the Barbieris because he had eaten a piece of Barbieri Nougat Surprise candy and found that there was cherry in it. "What kind of freak puts cherry in nougat?!" He then asks Batgirl if she's not disgusted by the "meaningless waste of human life" he caused. She says yes, the Joker places a gun in front of her and asks why she doesn't do anything about it. She doesnâ€™t.
- Joker bolts her to a spinning wheel  to throw knives at her. Batman appears and takes down the Joker's thugs. The Joker fires a gun at Batman, hitting him once before Batgirl breaks free and grabs his gun. She calls him nuts and begins to laugh at him, enraging the Joker. The police arrive immediately grab him.
- Jim Gordon gets home later to find Barbara in bed. She asks him if he thinks his job is exciting. He replies that after a while, it's not about good or bad, it's about people getting hurt or not.
