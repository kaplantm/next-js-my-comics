- Ran concurrently with Tales of the Teen Titans, which picked up the numbering from The New Teen Titans (Volume 1). Although the two titles were published simultaneously, The New Teen Titans took place some six months after the events chronicled in Volume 1.
- Midway through the series run, the editors realized that almost none of the feature characters were teenagers any longer. In order to correct the series' misnomer, the title was changed to the The New Titans with issue #50.
- The New Titans continued publication until February of 1996 ending with issue #130. Later that year, the Titans were relaunched with an all-new team in The Teen Titans (Volume 2).
