- At Titans Tower, Raven receives a cryptic, anonymous call followed by a strange noise. Cyborg manages to trace the call, and Speedy volunteers to investigate the strange noise.

- Roy has determines that the strange noise was a coded message. Jericho indicates that the message must be given to Dick.
- In Gotham City, Nightwing and Commissioner Gordon wait by the Bat-Signal, but he doesn't show. They both express concern for Batman's stability. - Raven appears and delivers a disc of Batman's design with a message for Nightwing.
- The disc has clues and records relating to Two-Face's recent crimes. Dick uses the clues to find Batman's location. Batman admits that he needs Dick's help, but insists they do it his way, despite Dick's objections.
- Dick sneaks into the basement through a back window, and Batman enters from the front to find that the building's contents have been nailed to the ceiling, upside-down. Wondering why, they eventually come to the conclusion that with the ground floor upside-down, the basement becomes the second floor.
- Suddenly, Dick is cornered by Two-Face. Two-Face detonates a bomb, causing Batman to fall through the floor into the basement, covered in rubble.
- Back at the Batcave, Tim and Alfred realize that something is wrong when a homing signal that Dick activated goes dead.
