- The Titans are trying to find Dick. They haven't heard from him in a week. They investigate his apartment, and find a page missing from one of his scrapbooks - someone must have broken in, and someone knows Dick and Nightwing are the same. 	
- Meanwhile, Dick returns to Haly's Circus. The circus has fallen on hard times.There have been a number of accidents at the circus, cutting attendance, and costing money.
- As the circus show starts, Tim Drake, who has been looking for Dick, sits in the audience with his camera. During the lion tamer's act, one of the lionesses attacks him, prompting Dick, who has disguised himself as a clown, to leap into action. He uses the trapeze to launch himself into the air, and drops a net over top of the lioness. Tim recognizes Dick.
- Mr. Haly resigns himself to closing down the circus, but Dick feels there's more to the story. 
- Dick wanders outside. He comes across Tim, who suggests that Harry the clown drugged the cat so she would attack the lion tamer. Dick investigates.
- In Harry's tent, Samson the strongman and Pedro the dwarf accuse Harry of murdering the lion tamer. However, Pedro lets slip that he knows where the flask used to drug the cat was found. Realizing the out way Pedro would know that is if he was guilty, Harry reveals that he is actually Dick in disguise, and subdues Samson. Pedro runs off, but Tim stops him.
- Afterwards, Dick becomes the co-owner of Haly's Circus.
- Dick wants to know more about time, but instead, the boy shows Dick evidence that Two-Face is back in Gotham City. The boy pleads that Batman needs a Robin.
- In Gotham, Two-Face watches Batman from his window, ominously.
