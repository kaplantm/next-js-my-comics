- Death Dancer kills a woman while her nephew watches. The boy then started to roam the streets of Gotham City with his sweater all covered in blood.
- Azrael question Barbara about the mysterious deaths. Barabara has no info, but suggests he check in with Dr. Thomkins. Azrael goes to her medical center in Crime Alley. 
- As he is telling her about the recent deaths, a nurse brought in the boy covered in his aunts blood. He shows them where his aunt was killed. They encounter man nearby asking for help - his wife is trapped in rubber from a building collapse. Azrael pulls her from the rubble and works with Leslie to save the woman's life.
- Leslie tells Azrael about Alvin Kothers, a man she knew who studied medicine and dancing, two of the things that fit with the killer's M.O., and that he used to live her Barbara's place. Azrael hurries back to that area.
- Barbara is out for a stroll when she is attacked by the Death Dancer, but Azrael stops him.
- Azrael was injured in the fight so he went to Leslie's afterwards. After a few words of wisdom from Leslie, Azrael stayed at the medical center to help out (throughout this comic there is been the theme of Leslie disapproving of vigilante violence, and Azrael trying but often failing to avoid it).
