- Azrael stops some guys from stealing from Leslie’s medical center, but is bummed because he feels like all does is violence. He mentions this to Leslie, who thanks him for all he’s done for her center. He is exhausted, and goes to find a place to sleep.
- Azrael thinks he sees his dead father in the corner of his eye, but when he turns around its gone.
- Jean-Paul sees someone running from the medical center. Thinking it was a thief, Azrael stops them. Turns out its Mitzi Fredang, the girl he helped some time ago. She said she was running from her (dead) murderous uncle. Mitzi told Jean-Paul that she was also looking for her mother, but that she lost track of her when her mother ran to the Gotham gas company building. Azrael goes into the building to search for her.
- Suddenly, the spirit of St. Dumas appears and tells Azrael that it was time for him to get away Gotham. In the end, Azrael tried to rationalize the situation and told St. Dumas that he was just an illusion from his mind, caused by exhaustion and hunger. Before leaving, St. Dumas told him where Mrs. Fredang was and also told him about a boat sunk nearby Dixon's Docks.
- Azrael find Mrs. Fredang and reunites her with Mitzi.
- After, Azrael find the boat St. Dumas told him about and starts sailing away from Gotham. In the middle of the way, Azrael had a change of heart and returns.
- He gave Mitzi and her mother the boat so they could leave the city. They sail away into the unusual fog. Suddenly, Mrs. Fredang says that Jerry is somewhere, very close to them.
