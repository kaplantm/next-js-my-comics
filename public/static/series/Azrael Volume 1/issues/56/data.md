- Somewhere in the city, a man is shot. Batgirl arrives, disarms the shooter and takes the injured man to Leslie's medical center. Batgirl leads Azrael to the site of the shooting, where they find the shooter and batgirl managers to knock his out with only minor injuries. Leslie is impressed by her control. 
- Batman appears and gives them info on where to find scratch. Before leaving, Azrael promises Leslie that he won't use violence unless it is completely necessary. Azrael decides to get into the place as Jean-Paul while Batgirl remains outside.
- Inside, Jean-Paul sees Nicholas Scratch giving a speech about taking control of the city by force, using weapons he had hidden in the city. Jean-Paul is recognized as Azrael (same person as was shot earlier) and Scratch captures him.
