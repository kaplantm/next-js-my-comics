- Nicholas Scratch is on a TV broadcast and says Gotham is an evil city at its core and that the country would wasting money if they decided to rebuild it, they should lie the city die.
- Meanwhile Azrael finds the congressman he is looking for and saves him from a bomb.
- Batman asks why Valley disobeyed his orders. Valley explained that he overheard Scratch's plans and so he had to act. Batman is surprisingly proud, not mad, Batman tells him that the congressman he saved, voted for Gotham's reconstruction (although he was outvoted). Batman says they still work together and with a handshake, Jean-Paul is once again part of the bat-family.
