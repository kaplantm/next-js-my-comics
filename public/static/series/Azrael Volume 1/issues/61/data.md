- The Joker has kidnapped babies and was holding them somewhere in Gotham.
- Azrael and Batgirl go to the the Watchtower. On the way, Azrael talked to Batgirl and he realized that they had a lot of things in common, since they were raised to be perfect assassins. Azrael asked Batgirl to remove her mask and when she did, he told her that she had a nice face.
- When they arrived, Oracle told them that they were going to look for Joker and the kidnapped babies in CampLex. Before they left, Oracle gave them some Christmas presents. Azrael and Batgirl were surprised and didn't understand the meaning of it as they had never had a Christmas in their lives. Oracle got Batgirl a perfume and Azrael a harmonica.
- On their way to CampLex, Batgirl dances to Azrael’s harmonica. Azrael figured that it was her Christmas present for him and he felt sorry for not having something for her.
- They arrived at CampLex and fight off Luthor’s henchmen. Then Mercy approaches warning them to leave. Azrael notices there are baby dolls hanging from the camp Christmas tree and realizes they are booby traps by Joker. A second before the dolls exploded, Azrael shields Mercy and Batgirl with his own body. He suffers some nasty burns. When he was lying on the ground he noticed that something fell from the tree and grabbed it before the paramedics and took him to Leslie's medical center.
- When Jean-Paul regained consciousness, Leslie told him that his actions saved two people's lives. His hair was completely gone but his costume protected him from the explosion. Leslie gave him the ornament he grabbed from the tree and he realized that it was an angel figurine. Jean-Paul gave her the angel to Batgirl as a Christmas girl.
