- It has been two weeks since James Gordon was shot by Jordan Reynolds aka Officer Rich, a man whose life had been destroyed after Gordon had arrested him many years ago.
- Gordon is out of hospital, walking with the use of a cane, and has the difficult decision to retire.
- Renee Montoya, blames herself for their inability to prove that Reynolds was the man responsible.
- Gordon introduces the new Commissioner, Michael Akins, to the Batman, but the meeting does not go well. Batman does not agree with Gordon's decision.
- Soon afterwards, Montoya calls in sick, and Bullock suspects he knows where she's gone - to Rich's apartment to make him pay for what he did. He stops her from shooting the man, but threatens him himself as he leaves.
- Later, Gordon and Batman talk again, and the Dark Knight is persuaded to give Akins a chance.
- Still later, Jordan Rich's apartment stands empty, with a bloodstain on the floor...
