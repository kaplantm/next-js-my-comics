- Captain Gordon is very concerned - several criminals recently claim to have encountered a young boy when they were stopped by Batman - it seems that Gotham's protector has begun endangering a child's life and Gordon does not approve. 
- When he summons Batman to talk about the situation, his friend explains his reasons for taking the boy.
- Several police officers are frozen to death in an encounter with Mr. Freeze, though Robin saves the Commissioner's life. 
- When Robin is threatened, the Commissioner can see the same concern in Batman's eyes that is in his own when he thinks of his adoptive daughter Barbara. He doesn't know who this 'Robin' is, but he sees him as much-needed 'family' for the Dark Knight.
