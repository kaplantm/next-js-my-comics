- In the wake of the death of Jason Todd and of Barbara Gordon's shooting, both at the hands of the Joker, Batman has become distant and remote. 
- He isn't answering the Bat-Signal, and he is beginning to think that he should remain in the shadows, just a rumor. If he does, then maybe Gotham City will stop producing monsters like the Joker, and he can live with his guilt. 
- Barbara Gordon comes to see him and shocks him out of his isolationism - her father isn't used to coping with things alone like Batman is, and he needs his friend around. Batman has a heart to heart with Commissioner Gordon, and agrees to continue helping the police department whenever they need him. They console each other for their recent tragedies, and reaffirm their friendship.
