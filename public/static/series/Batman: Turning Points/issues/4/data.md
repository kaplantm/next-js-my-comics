- All is not well. Batman is behaving differently (more violently, killing criminals) for  to how he has always behaved (because he actually is Jean-Paul Valley), and Commissioner Gordon begins to fear that he will have to stop him.
- Robin is not forthcoming when Gordon speaks to him. It appears that Gotham City's greatest protector may have become one of its monsters, and Gordon does not know what to do about it.
