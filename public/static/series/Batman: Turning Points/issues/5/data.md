- Batman is back and working with GCPD again. 
- Hale Corbett has returned to Gotham and is trying everything he can in order to speak to the Commissioner and Batman - Gordon suspects he's looking for revenge.
- However, when they catch up to him on the roof ofÂ Gotham City Police Headquarters, they discover that he has actually come to thank them - they stopped him doing something stupid, and he has been able to rebuild his life since then. He has brought his new wife and adorable daughter along to meet them. The two old friends are pleased to see such a positive display of the fruits of their work.
