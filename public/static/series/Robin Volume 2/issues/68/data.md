Stephanie is happy to finally return to her optimal physical condition but her joy is crushed when her mother finds her Spoiler costume and requests an explanation.

- Mangles and Gearhead are still wandering the sewers and after a lot of time, they realize they are lost.
- Robin looks for any sign in the sewers, he hears a voice coming from down of a tunnel and discovers Ratcatcher. He has gathered a great group of rats in the storage vault and is planning to feed his animals with all that food and make them grow in numbers so that he can claim the city his own. Robin is listening to the madman's plan when a rat suddenly bites him and makes him fall down to the ground. Ratcatcher is glad to see another source of food for his animals and Robin finds himself surrounded by rats.
