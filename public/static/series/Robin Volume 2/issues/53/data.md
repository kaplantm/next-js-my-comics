- Quakemaster is holding Mackenzie Bock hostage after Bock discovered his location. Robin, Montoya and Bullock also figure out his location and arrive.
- Robin talks to Quakemaster, who refuses to say the words "Robin" and "Batman". Montoya and Bullock free Bock and find Relazzo.
- They discover Quakemaster that he is just a puppet controlled by Arnold Wesker, the Ventriloquist. When cornered, Wesker drops Quakemaster and takes Scarface from a chest.
- Wesker shoots at Robin and Bock and he runs away. Bock shoots right through Scarface's head. Wesker falls to the ground and asks for a doctor to care for Scarface.
- Elsewhere, Batman finds a dog on the street that leads him to a place where many people are trapped. Batman saves the people.
- Nightwing arrives at City Hall in time to stop Wesker's henchmen from harming Mayor Grange and Gordon. When he is fighting the last henchman, the building starts to collapse and he manages to escape from the falling building, saving the thug's life.
- Batman, Robin and Nightwing contemplate the devastation caused by the earthquake and they are just relieved that the worst part was over, at least for that moment.
