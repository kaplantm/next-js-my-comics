- Bruce Wayne is having trouble coming to grips with the No Man's Land. He goes to Monaco to play up his playboy reputation, but finds little satisfaction in how things are preceding. He hates playing the role of Bruce Wayne.
- Huntress meanwhile tries to maintain law and order in Gotham. The locals do not fear her in the same way that they fear Batman, so she assumes a bat theme costume.
- Bruce eventually returns. He immediately recognizes the new Batgirl as the Huntress and decides to observe her. He's concerned that she may go over the line.
- Huntress encounters Ferak, a living plant woman, one of Poison Ivy's creations. The Huntress calms Ferak down, realizing that she is just a confused creature. She leads her to Robinson Park where she can be with other plants. Batman is impressed. No longer concerned about the Huntress' motives, Batman swings off to serve Gotham.
