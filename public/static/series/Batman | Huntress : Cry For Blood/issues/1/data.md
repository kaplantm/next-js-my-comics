- Police recover the body of Claudio Panessa from the Gotham River. Panessa is the cousin of Helena Bertinelli, and crossbow bolts in the body makes Huntress a suspect.
- Batman breaks into Helena's apartment. Helena denies having anything to do with it. She still is angry that Batman never accepted into his “family".
- After Batman leaves, Helena thinks about the history of her family. Her great-grandfather Giuseppe Bertinelli came from Sicily to Gotham and established his mafia family which ruled Gotham with four other families: Galante, Cassamento, Beretti and Inzerillo.
- The Panessa’s wanted to be the sixth ruling family, but Helena's ancestors, who led the five families, resisted this, even after the Bertinelli and Panessa families were united by marriage (Helena’s parents).
- When Helena was 8 years old both her parents and brother were killed before her eyes. The Panessas took care of Helena and sent her to Sicily. The Galantes took over the lead of the families and the Panessas were allowed to join the group. Helena did not learn about her mafia heritage until she was 15 years old.
- Helena decides to visit her family to offer condolences. Members of all mafia families are present, and Helena overhears them talking about taking down the Huntress.
- Driving home she nearly runs over a faceless man who is standing on the road and seems to be waiting for her, knowing her both as Helena and Huntress.
