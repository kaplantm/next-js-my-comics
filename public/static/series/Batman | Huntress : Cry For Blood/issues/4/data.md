- While traveling back to Gotham, Helena Bertinelli explains to Vic Sage the events that took place after her family was killed. Tomaso Panessa decided to bring Helena to Sicily so that his nephew Sal Asaro protect her.
- As a young girl Helena did not understand anything about the family business, but she observed how the Asaros combat trained regularly. Because Helena was having nightmares, Sal decided to train her so she was able to defend herself.
- One day, the Asaros and other mafia members were arrested and Helena was sent to a boarding school in Switzerland. There, Helena finally found out about her family’s mafia associations - and lost her rose-colored view of the mafia, finally seeing them as a killers rather than “robinhoods”.
- At the age of 16, Helena returned to Gotham City to spend time with Uncle Tomaso and the rest of the family during christmas holidays. But the event was disturbed by none other than Batman. This set an example for Helena that one could fight crime, even against the five families, and the Huntress was born.
- In the present, Helena and Vic finally arrive in her apartment in Gotham. But Batman is already waiting for her.
