- Helena Bertinelli wakes up in a cabin in Canada with two men, Richard Dragon (Sensei) and Vic Sage (The Question), who brought her here.
- Robin thinks Helena is innocent and wants to find out the truth. Both him and Oracle dig into her past. After her parents and brother were killed, all other Bertinellis were eliminated as well.
- Vic explains to Helena that Richard is kind of a teacher who shows you how to live. He warns her not to go back to Gotham City so soon, or she will die. Helena trains with sensei mentally and physically to better understand who she really is. 
- After three months Vic and Helena return to Gotham. As they are waiting at a bus station, Vic asks how Helena became the Huntress.
