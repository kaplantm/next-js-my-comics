- Batgirl dives off the top of a tall skyscraper. Batman cuts her line with a Batarang, and Robin swoops down to catch her (her line wasn't the right type and would've dislocated her shoulders). They dose her with knockout spray and take her back to the Batcave.
- Batman begins interrogating her, then pretends to attend to other matters allowing Robin the chance to play "good cop". Robin let her run through a training simulation to test her resilience and reflexes, but she doesn't impress Batman. Batman returns to the cave and tells her that their business is too dangerous for her, and is not to be treated as a game. They spray her again with the knockout gas and return her home.
- When she awakens, Barbara is angered that Batman and Robin know who she really is. 
- The next day, Robin secretly sends her a package. The box is filled with Batarangs, smoke grenades and a grappling supplies. A note is enclosed which reads, "You look like a fast study. This'll help you cram. Trust me. He'll come around."
