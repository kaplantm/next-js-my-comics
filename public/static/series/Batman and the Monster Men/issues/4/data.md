- Batman begins fighting/avoiding the monsters. Strange is impressed.
- Batman is soon finally caught by one of them. They ripped off the Utility Belt and cape is separated from the cowl.
- Batman frees himself and reaches some handcuffs from his utility belt. Batman cuffs a monster to a grate in the floor, and the monster’s strength pulls it free. Batman escapes into the sewers.
- Strange was so amazed by Batman that he decided to use his DNA in his next experiment. 
- Batman manages to get home. The next morning, Bruce is awoken by Julie, who sneaked her way into Bruce's bedroom. Julie is shocked by Bruce’s injuries. Bruce explained that he had an accident while playing polo the last night. Julie is still concerned and she tells Bruce that she had noticed scars before and even that she thought some of them were bullet wounds. Bruce tells her that he was a grown man and that he knew how to take care of himself. 
- That night, Strange is working with Batman's DNA obtained from the poisoned dart when some of Maroni's henchmen arrive. They destroy Strange's test subjects and warned him to avoid unusual events (e.g. massacres) around the next time of his payment. When they left, Strange commands Sanjay to follow them in order to learn Maroni's secret hideout.
- In the Batcave, Bruce was listening in via a bug he placed in Sanjay's robes, so he knows Maroni is in grave danger.
