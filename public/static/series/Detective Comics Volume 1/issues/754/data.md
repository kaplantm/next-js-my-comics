- Detectives Montoya and Allen try to interview Jordan Rich (who shot Commissioner Gordon) to get a confession.
- However, he is confident there is not enough physical evidence for a conviction, so he doesn't confess.
- At St Luke's Hospital, James Gordon wakes and admits he did not see the man who shot him. 
- The police have to let Rich go.
- Batman confronts Rich, but is told that he's powerless - if he doesn't have it in him to kill Rich, he'll never have justice. Montoya watches the confrontation from the shadows.
