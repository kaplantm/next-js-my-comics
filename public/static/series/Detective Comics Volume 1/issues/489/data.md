- The League of Assassins tries to kill Bronze Tiger while he is recovering in the hospital. Batman stops them, and interrogates Tiger about Kane’s murder, but Tiger he doesn’t remember anything. 
- Batman tracks down the league (wild leaps of logic, i.e. "A chap ran into a bingo parlor and broke two number on the board - 5 and 7. It gives us a location! The two numbers indicate a spot on the geological map of the city. A way of thinking natural to a geologist!”) and fights a bunch of them, but Sensei escapes. 
- Batman is confident he will win next time.
