- Whisper and Abbott tell gang leaders Ekin Tzu and Able Crown that it was their rivals, the Odessa Mob and the Escabedo Cartel, who killed Tzu's wife and destroyed Crown's youth center.
- Whisper convinces Tzu that she has been sent from the heavens to aid him and demonstrated a snake-like ability to spit poison.
- Abbott kidnaps Vasily Kosov and Emanuel Escabedo.
- Batman investigates, and concludes that Ra's al Ghul is behind it all. While Batman is surveilling tracking Ekin Tzu, he is confronted by Whisper. He tries to discover what she is really doing in his city.
- Meanwhile, Abbott hands the two men over to Ekin and Able, who shoot them in cold blood as revenge for their supposed actions. Batman was distracted by Whisper and is too late to save them.
