- Otis Flannegan (Ratcatcher) attends his parole hearing, and while on the stand, takes out a flute to summon nearby rats and escapes, despite Batman and Robin trying to catch him.
- Dick tells Tim to research on Ratcatcher's past crimes, but they find out that Two-Face was released days before.
- Jack Drake asks Tim to play tennis that night, so no Robin.
- That night in some pub, Two-Face causes a disturbance.
- Meanwhile, Flannegan is in the sewers gathering rats. His plan is to send to block the main aqueduct to floor the city.
- Bats finds him (tracking device on a rat) and stops him.
