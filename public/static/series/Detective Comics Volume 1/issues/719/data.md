- Some prisoners are being transported to Blackgate Prison. Prisoner Morgan "Morgue" Tice tells story about how he defeated Batman, but we see flashbacks showing he actually got his ass kicked during a petty robbery.
- At the end, the shadow of a bat passes overhead, he screams in fear and the rest of his inmates laugh.
- Jolene Relazzo is a seismologist working for WE. Gotham City is overdue for an earthquake, but her data is shocking - there's going to be a tremendous earthquake coming. Placing a call to her superiors, she desperately pleads for them to pick up the phone... the call goes to the Batcave and there's nobody there.
