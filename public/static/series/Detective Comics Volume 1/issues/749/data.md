- Roberto Alonzo's body is found at the scene of the second bombing. The Mayor sees this as proof that he was responsible. The police department and Batman, however, are not convinced. 
- Batman discovers that explosives were carefully planted throughout the site, meaning that a demolitions expert was involved, and James Gordon discovers that the site was seriously over-insured. They reach the same conclusion: Ferris, half owner of the construction company, is responsible for the bombings, to collect on insurance money and to turn opinion against the OGs.
- Ferris is arrested. He even gets a punch in the face from Commissioner Gordon for his attitude to the OGs - on behalf of his late wife, Gotham born and bred and a casualty of the No Man's Land year.
