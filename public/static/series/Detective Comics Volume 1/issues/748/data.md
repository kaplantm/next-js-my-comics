- In the middle of the night, the police department investigates a fatal bombing at a Wayne Enterprises construction site. Signs point towards this being the work of militant OGs, disgruntled with the many difficulties they have suffered, even since the end of NML.
- OG spokesman Roberto Alonzo, a former associate of the Black Mask, points out that this is very unlikely, as Bruce Wayne is one of the few employers to have treated the OGs with the respect they deserve and given them the help they need.
- Mayor Dickerson pressures Gordon for a quick arrest for the crime. Gordon is reluctant to make an arrest without enough evidence, but eventually arrests Alonzo, whose name is was used to rent the car for the bombing.
- Meanwhile, Batman investigates Francis Piper, a known criminal who has been seen at some of Alonzo's rallies. Batman discovers that Piper had posed as Alonzo to rent the car. However, Piper claims that he doesn’t know who hired him to do this.
- Alonzo is released, but he is soon attacked, and his body is strapped to another car bomb deployed at a construction site owned by Coldwell and Ferris Construction.
