- While Bane infiltrates the hall of records, gangs are attacking Two-Face for the attacks he has been framed for. Batman and Robin leave Bane to rescue Two Face. Bane blows up the hall of records using explosives that are like mini nuclear bombs. 
- Bane tells the girl who he forces to help him to spread news of what she witnessed.
- Batman and Robin save Two Face, who promptly runs away.
- Robin asks Batman why they didnâ€™t stop Bane (besides saving Two Face). Batman explains Bane has no reason to destroy the records, but that someone else did and he wants the plan to succeed hoping that the real responsible party shows up.
