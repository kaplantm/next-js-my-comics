- James Gordon is now GCPD Commissioner. He announces he intends to work with Batman and installed the Bat-Signal. 
- The media criticizes this decision as the public sees no difference between Batman and the ruthless vigilante known as The Reaper, who used to operate in Gotham. 
- Elsewhere, Rachel Caspian is glad to receive her father Judson back home after his long absence. The next day, Rachel joins Leslie Thompkins, who introduces her to Bruce Wayne, hoping that Bruce would become a benefactor for Rachel's charity organization.
- Judson Caspian takes up the mantle he abandoned years ago, becoming The Reaper again.
- Batman locates the Reaper about to murder some prostitutes and he stops the killer. During the ensuing fight, Batman is beaten by The Reaper. He is barely able to escape alive via the sewer system.
- After recovering, Bruce decides to fight fire with fire and he chooses to confront The Reaper using Joe Chill's gun, the same that murdered his parents and he later retrieved from the crime scene.
