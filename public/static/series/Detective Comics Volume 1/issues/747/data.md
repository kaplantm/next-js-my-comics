- The continuing tension between the Original Gothamites (O.G.s, those who stayed in No Man's Land Gotham City and the Deezees (those who left) is illustrated by the trial of Reynaldo Martinez, where Detective Montoya has to testify. Martinez is accused of murder, having killed a man who wanted to take back his property on returning to the city - Martinez believes he was simply defending his own property as he has been living there for a year and the other man had abandoned it.
- It is Montoya's birthday, and she is frustrated. Renee's father is pushing her to find a man and start a family as she is "getting older”. At the GCPD Headquarters, nobody remembers Renee's birthday, yet, she receives an anonymous gift of tulips. 
- Commissioner Gordon tells her to take the rest of the day off, so she decides to track down the tulip-giver, and finds that they were sent by Bruce Wayne, a man she doesn't actually know. When she confronts him, he tells her that they are actually from Two-Face, who forged a bond with her during the No Man's Land year. 
- She visits Two-Face with cupcakes in Arkham Asylum, a visit which Harvey greatly appreciates, as does Batman, who leaves a note of thanks on Montoya's car, telling her that she gave Harvey peace.
