- Batman informs Commissioner Gordon Vasily Kosov and Emanuel Escabedo were killed by Ekin Tzu and Able Crown, though he cannot prove it. 
- He also reveals that Whisper A'Daire arranged the killing, and learns that she has been getting very close to the Mayor, having spent many evenings with him and his wife recently. 
- The next day, Bruce Wayne visits Mayor Dickerson and finds him with Whisper at his office. He sneaks a scale from her neck, which he runs through the Batcomputer, finding that it is very close genetically to a scale from a King Cobra. 
- Elsewhere, Kyle Abbott receives a consignment of a liquid that Able Crown's Burnley Town Massive is to introduce into the Gotham drug supply. This is touted as bringing immortality, but nobody is permitted to try it before it hits the streets.
- At the GCPD Headquarters, the case is discussed. They expect a lot of gang volatility in the coming weeks. 
- Batman asks Gordon why he hasn’t been home the past few days -Gordon says it reminds him too much of his late wife Sarah. 
- Later, Batman tracks down the safehouse which Whisper and Abbott are using, discovering a skin shed by Whisper and encountering Abbott, who once again fights him in wolf-like form. He is able to knock Abbott out and discovers a wealth of information the pair had gathered about Gotham's organized crime.
- At the same time, Whisper offers Ekin Tzu a taste of 'immortality'. When he drinks the tea she prepares for him, he is transformed into a bird-like form. As he writhes in pain, Whisper tells him the truth about his wife's death.
