- Batman interrogates Kyle Abbott. He uses a truth serum and learns that Abbott and Whisper A'Daire plan to use the crime syndicates under their control to flood the city with the serum that is extending their life spans. But, the serum transform its takers into animalistic forms are unpredictable and uncontrollable - Batman fears utter chaos in his city. 
- Meanwhile, Whisper brings the Sicilian mafia on board for drug distribution. Able Crown objects to this, and when Whisper and Ekin Tzu (now utterly under Whisper's control it seem) reveal their hash natures, he calls the police with an anonymous tip about the drugs warehouse.
- When Whisper find outs Abbott reveals info to Batman, she spits poison in his eyes and promotes Ekin Tzu to her right-hand man.
- Later, Batman interrupts the meeting with mafia boss Pasquale Galante before the latter can be given a sample of the serum. Ekin Tzu and Whisper A'Daire flee the scene, but when Tzu sees Batman, he surrenders, as the Bat is more sacred in his beliefs than either the snake (Whisper's animal) or the raven (his own).
- Whisper sheds her skin once more and disappears.
