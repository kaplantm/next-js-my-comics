- Batman arrives at Leslie's clinic olding an injured Robin. He explains that Robin was shot by the Mad Hatter. While Leslie works to save Robin, Batman dwells on his past.
- Leslie tells Batman that Robin is stable, but he might not make it through the night. Leslie yells at him for endangering a child. Batman tells her that he didn't choose Jason for this "work," Jason was chosen by the "work" just as Bruce was chosen many years ago. Leslie says Batman is making his choices sound noble when really they are selfish and childish.
- Bruce remembers the night Leslie took him home (foster parent after his parent's death). He snuck out to visit the cemetery where his parents were buried, then returned to the crime scene where they were murdered. He found the mugger's gun in the bushes and kept it for himself.
- Leslie tells Batman that she's always felt responsible for the way he turned out, even though she tried to shake him off his path. Batman tells her it was beyond her control. He also reminds her that he does a lot of other good besides fighting criminals, like supporting her clinic through the Wayne Foundation. Leslie tells him that Batman isn't the "real" him, and Bruce responds "it's the only me there is."
- Leslie recalls Bruce's education. In grade school, he was suspended for beating up a bully who was "extorting" lunch money from the other kids.
- In college, he changed completely. Bruce wanted to get the most out of higher education while still appearing to be an airhead playboy. He pretended not to pay attention in his lectures, but studied intensively in secret at night. When he needed to ask the professors a question he would create an elaborate disguise using the theater department and pose as a visiting student. When he needed to learn something too advanced for the professors he would break into the school after hours and do research. This was where he first learned stealthy infiltration. The school tried to expel Bruce Wayne at one point, so he simply donated a library.
- Leslie asks him why he still does this. Bruce asks her why she runs her clinic patching up gang members and drug addicts. Leslie replies "because I have to" and Bruce explains that he is the same. Leslie asks "but what about you? What about Bruce Wayne?" and Batman replies he's not sure if Bruce Wayne even exists anymore. Bruce Wayne is just another disguise to him.
- Bruce claims he's giving Jason an outlet for his rage instead of letting him feel lost like Bruce was at the same age.
- Despite this, Bruce expresses regret that he might have gotten Jason killed. He always assumed dying like this would be his "probable end" but hoped Jason wouldn't share the same fate.
- Bruce wonders if there is still a need for Batman. Leslie tells him that she hopes for a day when there are no more deaths because of crime, but until then there is a need for Batman and she's glad that he's there.
- Robin wakes up. Batman tells him that he no longer has to be Robin after this, and Robin replies "are you kiddin', Bruce? We've got work to do."
