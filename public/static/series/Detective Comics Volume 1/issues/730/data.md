- Bats and Alfred are in one of the satellite Batcaves discussing tagging territory. Bats calls it the new language of Gotham. That night, Bats tags protected territory.
- Next morning, Gordon doesn’t believe the tag is real, has someone paint over it in so people don’t falsely believe the area is safe.
- The same morning, Scarface's gang discovers Bat’s mark in their territory. They paint over it with their mark and leave a tagged corpse.
- Batman sees this and realizes respect for the symbol was lost while he was gone. He must make himself more visible.
- Batman tries to get info from citizen in Scarface’s territory, but they shoot at him once (which doesn't penetrate his suit). He realizes that Scarface’s thugs only have one bullet, he controls the ammo.
- Batman goes undercover and arranges a deal with Scarface to trade bullets.
- Batman also goes out during the daytime, and is visibly shot by a thug (not an armor piercing round). So, they think he’s unkillable.
- During the ammo deal, Batman beats up Scarface and his thugs, then takes over the territory.
- He tries to give the people more freedom, but realizes they need order, protection. He re-employs Scarface’s thugs to keep their system running while making it more equitable. Batman marks the territory as his own.
