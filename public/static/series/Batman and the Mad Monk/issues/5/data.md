- The Mad Monk and Dala are looking at the trap, but they cannot see who is in it. Meanwhile, in the trap, Batman wedges batarangs under the sliding walls to slow them, then blows open the trapdoor with plastique and escapes (although with injuries from the spikes). He sees that Julie Madison's car is gone, and he leaves.
- James Gordon is waiting atop GCPD, wondering why it's taking him so long. Batman appears, injured. Gordon tells Batman that they ID'd the Monk's victims, and the only commonality: they were all only children.
- Batman checks on Julie, and finds she's sleeping peacefully. He goes home to get his wounds sorted. Norman Madison watches him leave, in paranoid terror.
- In the Batcave, Alfred Pennyworth sews up Batman's wounds while Batman researches Rallstone castle. Although he is reluctant to believe in actual vampires, he is willing to consider it.
- Norman has a talk with Julie. He tells her that he may have to do something disastrous, and gives her a copy of his will and documents about his business. He thinks that saying a possible goodbye to her was the hardest thing he's ever done, and now he has to do the second hardest. Julie scarcely notices - the Monk's treatments have left her confused and sleepy.
- The Monk and Dala are about to go to sleep when Julie arrives, with her father's bank details. The monk knocks her out, and tells Dala to summon the Brotherhood.
- Bruce wakes up from a dream about his dead parents, suddenly sure Julie is in danger. He goes back to the castle.
- At the castle, the Monk tells the Brotherhood of Eternal Night that he will now make them immortal, and the final sacrifice is Julie.
