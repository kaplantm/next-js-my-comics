- Jame Gordon relocates from Chicago to Gotham. Starts working a GCPD under Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb.
- BW returns to the US after 12 years abroad, about to become Batman.
- Gordon realized Gotham police force is full of corruption, including the brutish Lt. Arnold Flass.
- Flass grows concerned and tells Commissioner Loeb that Gordon may not be a "team player" (not corrupt). Loeb gives Flass permission to teach Gordon a lesson, that night some officers beat up Jim in a parking lot. Gordon recognizes Flass voice and vows to strike back.
- Jim follows Flass to a bar. Waits outside then beats him up, leaves him naked, bound with his own handcuffs on the side of the road. Jim is confident that the incident will go unreported.
- BW (in vagrant disguise) patrols Gotham for the first time. He gets into an altercation w/ a pimp, and Selena Kyle gets involved too to defend Holly, an underage prostitue. Overall its a failure, he gets hurt, the police try to arrest him, people aren't intimidated and he's not in control of the situation.
- Back at the manor Bruce think's he's failed. Suddenly, a bat crashes through the open window. Bruce takes it as a sign and promises to avenge his parents' deaths by taking on the form of a bat.
