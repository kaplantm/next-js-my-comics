Strange psychoanalyzes Batman to be a mentally-disturbed egomaniac, motivated by nothing but past trauma and a lust for power. Gordon disagrees with this sentiment, but is forced to admit that Batman is technically a criminal.\n- Klass announces a new anti-vigilante taskforce, with Gordon as commander. Klass hires Strange as consultant on the Batman.\n- Bruce sees this announcement, and tries to distract himself by focusing on building a new crimefighting vehicle.\n- Gordon reluctantly gathers personnel for the taskforce, beginning with Cort - thought too unintelligent to be a serious threat - as second-in-command.\n- That night, an overeager Cort gathers his own draftees for the taskforce - for a raid on Cardona's main warehouse. Unfortunately, it turns out several of the officers on the taskforce are corrupt, and the Cardona has warning - the warehouse is empty, except for Batman who was also there to raid Cardona. The men attack Batman. Batman fights them off and escapes.\n- Meanwhile, in the privacy of his own penthouse, Strange tries to simulate Batman's psyche by donning a homemade Batsuit. He grows enthralled by the idea of being Batman, of sowing violence and terror in total anonymity.\n",

The Night-Scourge is unnerved by the encounter; he flees to Strange's penthouse. There, a fresh session of hypnosis coaxes him into obedience and a new costume: Strange's own homemade Batsuit.\n- Shortly after, \"Batman\" invades Mayor Klass's home and kidnaps Catherine, demanding amnesty from the horrified mayor in exchange for her return.\n",

Based on the size of the gun, Riddler suggests it might be a woman.\n- Meanwhile in the Batcave, Batman investigates the evidence left at Holiday's crime scenes. He theorizes the killer could be Sal Maroni, since he benefits from the death of the Falcone empire. However, Alfred suggests that the killer might be someone who pursues justice a little too far. \n- Batman analyzes the possibility that James Gordon or Harvey Dent might be the holiday killer. In the end, he comes to the conclusion that Gordon couldn't have done any of the murders, but Dent could.\n- At that moment, Dent and Gordon decide they will arrest Bruce Wayne for his involvement with Falcone and his dirty money.\n- Falcone is tired of The Riddler's guesses. He demands an answer. The Riddler supposes the holiday killer is Falcone himself. The answer is so ludicrous that Falcone and Sofia laugh at him. When the Riddler leaves the building, Holiday shoots his gun several times near the Riddler, leaving behind the gun and his umbrella. Riddler wonders why Holiday didn't murder him.\n",

Dent asks Mister Freeze to create an ice wall to delay the police from reaching them and then he tells The Mad Hatter to spread the word and get everybody out of the sewers.\n- After a fight with Dent and some of the other Rogues, Gordon tells Harvey to drop the gun and surrender his hostage, and after some tense moments, Dent does as Gordon told him, allowing Jim to place him under arrest. Batman contemplates the scene, hardly believing how things used to be in the past.\n- Later that night, in Haly's Circus, a man that works for Tony Zucco is threatening Mr. Haly by reminding him what happened to the Graysons. Suddenly, a rock smashed the window of the office and the man goes outside and finds little Dick Grayson, who asks him to tell whatever he knows about the death of the Graysons, but a second man attacks Dick from behind. At that moment, Batman arrives and takes the man out and tells them to stay off the circus, while Dick passes out.\n- Dick recovers and wakes in the Batcave, where he questions Batman and his motives for caring so much for him, believing that even Bruce Wayne doesn't care for him. Batman takes off his cowl and reveals his true identity to Dick, and he tells him that they have much to discuss.\n",

They realize that she recognized the killer.\n- Batman arrives and says Porter has been missing.

Scared, he sits up and finds that he is holding the gun used in his Holiday killings. Alberto jumps out of his bed and starts listening to \"his father's voice\" telling him that he is a shame to the Falcone family and that he should kill himself. Alberto knows that his father would never tell him to kill himself and he shoots at the mirror, revealing the Calendar Man on the other side.\n- Two hours later, Batman and Gordon arrive a the Falcone Estate.

There was no sign of Sofia. \n- Batman and Gordon find Porter's body in Alberto's room and they notice that she was killed with two shots from a .22 gun; just like Holiday's M.O.

Batman leaps back to the building and assumes that Catwoman is involved somehow in the hangman killings and he attacks her and forces her to confess where she has been for the last six months and why was she at the penthouse. Catwoman explains that the night Carmine Falcone was murdered, she scratched Sofia's face, just like she did her father. However, Sofia survived the fall from that night thanks to Catwoman's bola. As Catwoman explains the situation, Batman asks why she cares about Sofia and before she can answer, Batman leaves her talking alone.\n- Batman returns to the Batcave and it is revealed that he was using a special neck brace that prevented him from being killed by the noose. Dick Grayson is willing to help, but Bruce isn't in the mood to deal with him. Dick tells Alfred that he just wants to help, but Bruce never asks and Alfred tells him that Bruce may never ask for it.\n- At 2:00 a.m. of Columbus Day, Two-Face and his gang kill all the members of the Falcone Crime Family except for Sofia, Alberto and Mario.\n- Meanwhile, at the Gotham Cemetery, James Gordon and Julia Lopez await at Janice Porter's grave to meet with Mario Falcone, who is looking for protection after all that's happened. \n- At that moment at the Falcone Mausoleum, Sofia Falcone is taking care of his wounded brother, Alberto, who was shot by Calendar Man. Alberto wants to go to a Hospital, but Sofia wouldn't allow it because they would be discovered if they go to any hospital. Sofia tells him to be like their father, who survived being shot five times in the chest. Alberto replies that he is not their father and Sofia is infuriated by the answer and kills Alberto by asphyxiating him.\n- Later, Mario Falcone is taken to Gordon's office in the GCPD Headquarters, where he tells Gordon and Lopez about the deal he had with Janice Porter. Mario was giving Porter all the information about Sofia's movements in return of protection.\n- At that moment, Batman appears in Gordon's office and reveals to them that Sofia Falcone is the Hangman Killer. As soon as Batman finished his sentence, a big explosion destroys the windows of the office and many explosions across the city are destroying the streets.\n- The gas lines have been opened and set afire, causing the sewer system to collapse and forcing Two-Face and his gang leave their hideout in a hurry.\n- Two-Face is escaping when suddenly a noose falls around his neck and he is hanged from one of the main pipes. Sofia reveals herself to the man she hated the most for killing her father. Batman arrives, saving Two-Face and fighting Sofia.

Batman arrives and they work together to fight Two-Face and the Joker. \n- Two-Face pulls out a gun and points it towards Batman. Two-Face feels victorious for having eliminated all the organized crime in Gotham, turning him into the most powerful force in the city, until Joker shoots him and makes him fall to a dark abyss in the cave. \n- Joker tells Batman that he wouldn't let Two-Face have it all, because in the end, all he wanted was to get rid of the organized crime, just like the \"old\" Harvey Dent. Joker starts telling Batman that only they understand Gotham City but before he is finished, Dick knocks him down by breaking a staff in his face.\n- At the Falcone Estate, Mario has lost what he had left of sanity and he burned the whole place down after learning that Sofia Falcone murdered their own brother Alberto. As the last member of the Falcone Crime Empire, the man is left in a broken state.\n- Selina Kyle visits the reconstructed gravesite of Carmine Falcone and she reveals that she always robbed from him because she always had the right to claim some of his money to change her life into one that she deserved. She explains that she left for Italy in order to prove once and for all that she is Carmine's daughter. She failed, but deep inside, she is convinced that Falcone is her father.\n- Meanwhile, somewhere in Gotham's sewers, Two-Face keeps the corpse of the man he hated the most, Carmine Falcone, inside a block of ice.\n- In the Batcave, Dick tells that he chose his costume in honor of his dead parents and that his secret name from now own will be Robin.

While Leslie works to save Robin, Batman dwells on his past.\n- Leslie tells Batman that Robin is stable, but he might not make it through the night. Leslie yells at him for endangering a child. Batman tells her that he didn't choose Jason for this \"work,\" Jason was chosen by the \"work\" just as Bruce was chosen many years ago. Leslie says Batman is making his choices sound noble when really they are selfish and childish.\n- Bruce remembers the night Leslie took him home (foster parent after his parent's death). He snuck out to visit the cemetery where his parents were buried, then returned to the crime scene where they were murdered. He found the mugger's gun in the bushes and kept it for himself.\n- Leslie tells Batman that she's always felt responsible for the way he turned out, even though she tried to shake him off his path. Batman tells her it was beyond her control. He also reminds her that he does a lot of other good besides fighting criminals, like supporting her clinic through the Wayne Foundation. Leslie tells him that Batman isn't the \"real\" him, and Bruce responds \"it's the only me there is.\"\n- Leslie recalls Bruce's education. In grade school, he was suspended for beating up a bully who was \"extorting\" lunch money from the other kids.\n- In college, he changed completely. Bruce wanted to get the most out of higher education while still appearing to be an airhead playboy. He pretended not to pay attention in his lectures, but studied intensively in secret at night. When he needed to ask the professors a question he would create an elaborate disguise using the theater department and pose as a visiting student. When he needed to learn something too advanced for the professors he would break into the school after hours and do research. This was where he first learned stealthy infiltration. The school tried to expel Bruce Wayne at one point, so he simply donated a library.\n- Leslie asks him why he still does this. Bruce asks her why she runs her clinic patching up gang members and drug addicts. Leslie replies \"because I have to\" and Bruce explains that he is the same. Leslie asks \"but what about you? What about Bruce Wayne?\" and Batman replies he's not sure if Bruce Wayne even exists anymore. Bruce Wayne is just another disguise to him.\n- Bruce claims he's giving Jason an outlet for his rage instead of letting him feel lost like Bruce was at the same age.\n- Despite this, Bruce expresses regret that he might have gotten Jason killed. He always assumed dying like this would be his \"probable end\" but hoped Jason wouldn't share the same fate.\n- Bruce wonders if there is still a need for Batman. Leslie tells him that she hopes for a day when there are no more deaths because of crime, but until then there is a need for Batman and she's glad that he's there.\n- Robin wakes up. Batman tells him that he no longer has to be Robin after this, and Robin replies \"are you kiddin', Bruce? We've got work to do.\"\n",

She claims to be the Batman, and that the area is under her protection.\n\n### Interludes:\n\n- Punk tries to rob someone at gunpoint for batteries, but they realize his gun is unloaded because no one would waste bullets (rare) for batteries.\n- Punk tries to rob kid, but someone shows up and protects him.\n- Punk tries to rob stranger, but shit its the Joker and he gets stabbed. Joker tags a wall and declares the area \"Jokerville.\"\n",

Eventually reconstruction stops completely because of her activities.\n- Luther decides to make a deal with Catwoman. At the meeting point, Luthor asks Catwoman what it will take to stop Catwoman from targeting his operation. She tells him all he has to do is ask and say please; Luthor hesitates, but grudgingly does so. Catwoman says that's the only thing she ever wanted (…and she gets to rub it in Mercy’s fail that she failed to stop her). She knew she couldn't take Mercy on physically, so she went after her where it hurt the most: her pride.\n- Catwoman gathers her trio of henchmen. She gives Al and Lewis two passports and passbooks with a million dollars each in their accounts on the Cayman Islands. She then explains that she discovered why Mookie unharmed in explosions or when hit by bullets. Mookie is dead, and he has been ever since he was working for the Joker and his boss killed him. Ever since, he has gathered kinetic energy to create enough mass to make it seem as though he were alive. Mookie says it's all true.\n- Deadman then appears to take Mookie to the other side. Mookie wasn't sure about it, but Catwoman tells him it will be fine. Mookie goes with Deadman, and both move to the afterlife.\n- Catwoman leaves, knowing that word will get out and people will know that Catwoman takes care of her crew.\n",

Some wonder is Batman is to blame.\n- Police Commissioner Tolliver claims that he has deduced the killer's identity: Bruce Wayne. The police search the Manor and fine bloody gloves and a knife (planted by the real killer).\n- Bruce is brought, with Jacob Packer acting as his counsel. During the trial, Tolliver points out that Bruce was present in London during the time of the Ripper murders, the times that Bruce was absent late at night, and his medical training. Bruce is found guilty by the jury and is sentenced to be hanged.\n- Bruce is imprisoned at Arkham Asylum to await his execution. Inspector Gordon comes to visit Bruce and secretly passes on the police's findings related to the Ripper case at Bruce's request in order to clear his name by finding the actual murderer. Bruce eventually discovers a photograph showing Thomas Wayne and his colleagues as field surgeons during the American Civil War with a regimental flag bearing a symbol similar to the one on the murderer's weapon. He notes that Packer is the only remaining alive from the regiment.\n- Bruce then contacts Alfred and escapes, donning the Batsuit and to stop the Ripper, who had been patiently delaying his murder spree until Bruce’s execution.\n- Jacob explains his motive: he was in love with Martha Wayne, and she had no interest in him. This caused Jacob to see every woman as a \"whore\" like Martha, laughing at him and subsequently driving him to murder them. He also revealed that he hired a gunman to kill Bruce’s parents, but was angered by the fact that Bruce survived.\n- After revealing this, Bruce unmasks and punches Jacob upon his parents' grave.\n- GCPD arrives, preventing Bruce’s anger from escalating to murder. Batman (after concealing his face) informs Gordon that Jacob is the Ripper. Jacob admits his guilt.\n- As Gordon goes to arrest both Jacob and Batman, Jacob quickly slashes Batman and is gunned down by Gordon.\n- Batman thanks Gordon and reminds him to release Bruce Wayne. Gordon then asks about Jacob’s motive, and Batman only replies \"who truly understands a madman?\" After Batman disappears into the night, Gordon decides not to arrest the vigilante and believes that the police and Gotham need him as their \"guardian angel.\"\n",
